&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS:
DONE    1. Validate the nostim and ACh depletion cases. Da durations (Castro) with lower ACh during Da stim
DONE    2. bath and block cases for final tuning
DONE    	use ic start and earlier application for bath cases to save computational time
DONE	Possibly repeat all prior cases using better ic (end July)
DONE    3. Then, repeat 20hz vs theta, create signature (end July, begin Aug)
NOW    4. Multi-spine sims - spatial specificity (after signature and good IC) (Aug, while away)
    5. Other questions:
DONE    a. role of ACh during burst or pause or rebound? - repeat sims without ACh burst (already doing no rebound)
DONE    b. confirm role of CamKII phos Dgl? - repeat sims without pDgl - first need effective pDgl
NOW     c. Can molecules substitute for others in signature? - sims with altered Ca or CaMKII, etc - evaluate signature
	d. alcohol effects
    6. parameter robusteness

>>>>>>> Long Morphology sims
1. ACh stimultion looks a bit strange.  No rebound for some cases, too much dip towards end of 20Hz
2. Once again, PKAc greater for 20hz, CKpCam greater for theta
3. 2 spines theta has greater CKpCam than 1sp theta or 20hz, adjacent slightly greater than separated
4. Pkc is greater for theta than 20hz, but levels are quite low.  What approach could increase PKc without increasing 2ag basal?
------> increased 2ag degradation while increasing Dag (via rate or Plc quantity)
5. pDgl increases with the increase in CkpCamCa4, but little effect on 2ag because still only 10% of unphos.
5. No pause in Gi observed except at end with 6s pauses in ACh.  But observed pauses are much briefer.
-------->Increase rate of CKpCamCa4 phos of Dgl? 2-5x
-------->re-run short and/or long morph without ACh rebound? eliminate rebound burst
-------->accelerate production AND degradation of Gi to improve pause? 2-5x?
	    Would need to accelerate (10x) forward and backward rate of ACh binding to Gim4R and Gi binding to AChm4R

###### Theta and 20hz simulations with
       2x CKpCamCa4 phos of Dgl and CaDgl
       4x production AND degradation of Gi
       uses the no rebound stim file

       Model_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_Gifast-stimthetaNoReb.xml
       Model_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_Gifast-stim20hzNoReb.xml
       If these look better, will need to repeat all bath, block and Da sims with new params

>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. Discovered bug in 20Hz sims.  Part of Da stim was beginning at 50s instead of 20s - repeat all of these
2. NoRebound and 8s pause have only small effect on cAMP.  Both no rebound and 8s pause similarly increase D32p34 for theta(~200 nM inc), but 8s pause 300 nM inc with 20Hz, and small but noisy inc in CKpCam
3. Gifast-nostim: basal cAMP slightly lower 31 vs 51 nM; PKAc is lower: 4 vs 5 nM; D32p34 is lower: 635 vs 899
These low values are still reasonable.
4. the theta and 20hz did not run - need to repeat those sims, add in the rebound for comparison

>>>>>>>>using Gifast (and higher CKpCam phos of Dgl):
Small dip in GiaGTP during theta and 20 hz with no rebound
rebound has no effect on GsaGTP
AC5GsaATP has ~20% larger transient increases
AC5GsaGiaATP is ~20% larger without rebound.  IMPORTANT: the very large AC5GsaGiaATP concentration and the slow modulation of this molecule (especially compared to GiaGTP) suggest that it is protecting GiaGTP hydrolysis.  What if slowed down GiaGTP hydrolysis and allowed small AC5Gia or AC5GiaGsaATP hydrolysis?
Probably will not  change effect of rebound on cAMP and PKAc activity.
Small increase in cAMP with no rebound, and small increase in D32p34 with no rebound

phos of Dgl is significantly greater with theta than 20hz
This is sufficient to lower the 2ag during the 20hz stimulation compared to theta

Compared to not using Gifast (and slower CKpCamCa4 phos of Dgl):
	 CKpCamCa4 slightly greater (Theta) pDgl slightly greater.  Greater different in 2ag between theta and 20hz

Signature of PKAc+CKpCamCa4+PkcCaDag is greater for theta than 20hz, and no rebound increases the sig by 0.3 only
	     			     no PKAc
	  reb	norebound	     reb   norebound
20hz      9.5	9.8		     5.8   5.8
theta	  18.3	18.5		     15.3  15.6

Signature of 2ag is slightly greater for 20hz than theta: 10.6 vs 9.3 (no rebound) or 10.3 vs 9.3 (rebound)
What about including PP1 in signature - measure of PKA activity?  No good because (a) magnitude too high compared to other molecules and (b) smaller for 20hz than theta
PP2B? too transient

-------->What next?  Try an additional 2x CKpCamCa4 phos of Dgl?
     	      This will enhance the difference between theta and 20hz for 2ag.
     	      Better constraints are needed for these values.

-------->What happens if block CKpCamCa4?  Increase in 2ag for theta? lower of LTP signature?  minimal change in 20hz sign?
-------->What happens if block Da?  Excluding PKAc from signature doesn't change things, so might not block LTP.
-------->What happens if eliminate initial ACh burst.

Block Da = no Da release? (use the no-rebound to compare)
Block initial ACh burst = no additional ACh, nor dip nor rebound? - compare to the no rebound case.
Block CKpCamCa4 = cannot be done with stim files.  Ideally, add molecule to binds to active CKCam?
KN62: IC50 = 0.9 Î¼M.  Binds to calmodulin binding site of the enzyme (tocris)
autocamtide: IC50=40 nM (available myristolated for cell permeability) - use 0.5 uM?
competitive with the substrate/autophos site.  Simulate this one to minimize altering calmodulin binding

###########Repeat all Gifast reactions with the new reaction to allow using IC

	    Model_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_Gifast-stim20hz-noCKp.xml
Model initial values: AIP binds with kb=1e-3, kf=25e-6. inject to reach ~10 uM (90 ms - similar to CyA)
Might not be fast enough to find the transient CKCamCa4 (Kb=3e-3).
If not, speed up 10x.  If conc too high, decrease inject duration from 90 to 60 (similar to OA).

If good signatures, need to repeat the controls : Da stim, block & bath, with these new parameters

>>>>>>>
1. re-evaluation of Gifast with new reaction (non-function with theta/20hz and noReb)
   Qualitatively same 
2. evaluate effect of no rebound, no ACh, no Dopamine, no CKp
noDa: Da is indeed 10 nM througout, cAMP exhibits no increases
noACh: ACh is ~40 nM throughout, Gi does not exhibit increases, allowing slightly sooner increase in AC5Gsa and cAMP. AC5GsaGiaATP shows very little difference - slow build up.  This suggests that this reaction is too slow to sense the pulses of GiaGTP!  AC5Gia is indeed following the stimulation, but AC5GsaGia is not.  The increase in AC5GsaGia requires 1st Gsa bind and then Gia bind, the Gia binding.  Gia binding is much faster (30x) than Gsa binding, so tha latter is rate limiting.  Try 10x faster binding (and unbinding).  Could also allow Gi binding first.  Interestingly, Gsa binding to AC1 is 100x faster!
Speeding up Gsa binding might allow slowing back down the Gia, or 
GqaGTP also is much lower.  Both Pkc and 2ag are lower, though less than 10% difference.  This suggests that the basal GqaGTP is sufficient to activate Plc.  OR, GqaGTP in the spine is sufficiently high due to mGluR.  Should test it's effect - noMGlu
noCKp: CKpCamCa4 looks identical to the control.  AIP is 9 uM, but no binding to CKCam - mistake in rates - re-run
noReb: sort of control

------->GOAL with Gi/Gs part: see an effect of no Gi transient on cAMP.  If achieved, repeate bath, block, Dadur sims as well as simulation experiments

>>>>>>>>Sept 12, 2016 - Effect of faster Gs
GiaGTP: minimal difference - maybe slightly larger dip
GsaGTP: peaks are smaller (~40 vs ~60)
AC5Gsa: peaks are larger - 30-40 vs 20-30
AC5Gia: larger modulation of peaks
AC5GsaGia: larger value, no peaks/modulation visible
AC5GsaGiaATP: larger, and more modulation of peaks
AC5GsaATP: larger, larger peak modulation
AC1Gsa: smaller
AC1GsaCamCa4ATP: slightly smaller, probably because Gs is now binding more to AC5
cAMP: larger peaks

noMgluR vs noACh burst: it appears that only one of these has a reduced GqaGTP burst.
noMGlu appears to have full height GqaGTP; HOWEVER, if plot just the spinehead - the difference is apparent.

Other sims:
noDa: much lower PKAc, D32p34; higher D32p75
noCKp: much lower CKpCamCa4. pDgl is only ~20% of Dgl, so blocking CKp is not producing much effect
noAChburst: significantly lower PkcCaDag, but slightly greater D32p34.
noMGlu: minimal effect on overall mean PkcCaDag, possibly higher in the spine head???  

CKCam block is effective - only using 3 of 10 uM (6 uM free), so can reduce AIP to 2/3:
-------->decrease inject duration from 90 to 60 
But, CKCam block is still not producing much increase in 2ag
---------->increase CKpCam phos rate of Dgl still more?

Signatures:
1. Blocking CKCamCa4 greatly reduces the signature for theta, but only slightly for 20hz.
2. Blocking Da has no effect on theta signature, but does reduce signature for 20hz; BUT, that might be because the CKpCam is much larger for theta.  Perhaps a normalization is needed so that each molecule counts the same.
CKp block also increase 2ag and reduces Pkc for theta, though effect is small.
3. blocking ACh burst slightly increases spine signature for both theta and 20hz - i.e., the Gi inhibition from m4 has very little effect.  No effect on dendrite signature.
WIth GiGsfast simulation, blocking ACh causes trivial change in signature: reduction in Pkc, but slight increase in PKAc.  Most significant effect is reduction in 2ag and Pkc without initial burst of ACh - this is a Gq effect.  Similar effect seen with theta and 20hz. 
blocking mGluR also has very small effect.  Quite interesting that blocking either ACh or mGlu alone have such small effect on Dag requiring molecules.  Is calcium sensitivity too high?  Is Gq sensitivity of Plc too low? - not too much higher than BoHung model.  What happens if both are blocked?
PlcCaPip2: basal ~30, peaks~280
All PlcGq forms: peak = 10 - so contributing negligibly!
GaqGTP: peaks<=20 - so not very much.   This explains those results.  Calcium sensitivity is so high, and Gqa so low, that blocking it does nothing.  Gq is only 2 uM, though it is more abundant than Gs and Gi.  Perhaps increase Gq by 5x? Problem is that it will be close to Pip2 concentration. 

Response to bath application (Gifast):
   	Dp34tot	   	   Dp75
Da	570/4600n	   6288
Ca	580/305n	   6400
DaCa	570/3200n	   4960
Great basal.  Good increase with Da, which is reduced by Ca.
Good calcium induced decrease, though too transient - unclear why so transient, possibly due to diverting Pp2Acal from D32p34 to D32p75.  However, this is better than prior sims, which never showed a decrease.
D32p75 - fine - similar to previous
CyA:   555/774		9753
OA     555/770/0	50000
OA causes transient increase in D32p34, but then it decreases because all of the D32 is converted into D32p75.  Might need to reduce the OA block - yes.  Too strong and blocking everything.  Reduce by ~30%: dur=40 instead of 60
CyA still leaves similar amount of PP2BCamCa4 interacting with D32p34.  Keep as is.
Perhaps we need to PP2Acal to have some activity against D32p34???  Do this first with the non-PP1 bound form.  Either no effect, or slow effect (which is what we want).

What next?
-------->decrease AIP inject duration from 90 to 60 - expected to have no effect
-------->increase CKpCam phos rate of Dgl still more?  3x, in with GiGsfast file
-------->OA block - duration =40 instead of 60
------->increase Gqabg quantity - do this with GiGsfast model.  This may help with Uchigashima also.
------->PP2Acal has activity against D32p34
Initialize with greater Gq:

If good, repeat block/bath/DaDur using above and update spreadsheet
Also simulate the noDa and noMGluR cases
What other simulations should be used as constraint?
a) simulate Colbran experiments using CamKII?
b) Parul will repeat the Uchigashima simulations

PlcCaPip2: basal ~30, peaks~90-100 (20hz) 190-200 (theta) - peaks smaller than previous
PlcGq forms: peak = 12 (20hz) or 16 (theta) : larger than before
GaqGTP: peaks=40 - double previous simulations
ACh is significantly reducing Dag and Ip3
CKp block produces significant reduction in pDgl forms (~25%).  50% reduction for theta burst!
CKp block: elevation in 2ag for both 20hz and theta, reduction in PkcCaDag, especially for theta
Overall: CkpBlock significantly reduces signature (Pkc+CkpCam+PKAc) for theta, but only slightly for 20hz: with CKpblock, theta signature is similar to 20hz signature

ACh block: reduction in Gqa, Dag and Ip3 for both theta and 20hz.
    	   reduction in 2ag (20% for 20hz, 30% for theta) and Pkc
	   no AC5Gia transient increases or AC5GsaATP transient decreases - 
	   But, GiaGTP dips not observed, even though degradation is 4 per sec.
	   Also, only slightly smaller Ac5GsaGiaATP.  cAMP transients are slightly higher, especialy at beginning of train.  pPDE builds up and may prevent a larger difference
	   This negative feedback loop may explain why no difference in PKA activity for two paradigms
	   signature:Pkc+CKp+Pka       	   	       2ag
	  norebound  noCKp	  noACh burst	       norebound  noCKp	  noACh burst
20hz      10.4	     7.1	  9.1		       11.5	  13.9	  7.6
theta	  22.0	     6.2	  22.2		       8.1	  12.4	  5.3
ratio of LTP sig to 2ag:
20hz  	  0.9 	    0.5		1.2
theta	  2.7	    0.5		4.2  

2ag goes up and signature goes down: predict no LTP, possibly enhanced 20hz LTD with CKpblock
noACh burst is more subtle. 2ag goes down a bit due to its Gq contribution, smaller to trivial change in signature, possibly due to Gi contribution to PKA.

*************To compare to experiments, would need to block m1 receptor (new rxn), or mGluR receptor (stim file ready).  Could also block m4 receptor (new rxn) to make prediction.

Response to bath application (GiGsfast):
   	Dp34tot	   	   Dp75
Da	sims didn't run
Ca	1.2/688n	   6100
DaCa	1.2/3300n	   4970
Basal: D32p34 is a bit higher than before - perhaps too high. cAMP is 61 - producing too much PKAc
Good calcium induced decrease, to 688 and persistant.
D32p75 - fine - similar to previous
CyA:   1208/1029 - no increase at all!!!
OA     very transient increase in D32p34, and then decreases due to D32p75 saturation

Why does CyA block not have any effect?  Basal calcium = 32, PP2B = 6-8 bound to Dp34 = 4-6, Pp2A bound is 23!  Affinity of PP2B is higher, but it's basal quantity is much higher due to such low CamCa4 due to low calcium.

Lowering cAMP to lower D32p34 will not solve problem of such low PP2B.
------------->What were Jeanette's values to solve this problem?
-------------> Add in m4 block rxn and m1 block rxn before re-running everything
------------->solve the CyA block problem and re-run everything.  Then run the 2 spine cases.
-------------->Compare m4 block with m4 block+no Da - rescue?
-------------->Research effects of alcohol.

&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

For publication, do we simulate a D2R model?  Or alcohol effects?
