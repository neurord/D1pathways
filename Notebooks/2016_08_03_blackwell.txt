&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS:
DONE    1. Validate the nostim and ACh depletion cases. Da durations (Castro) with lower ACh during Da stim
DONE    2. bath and block cases for final tuning
DONE    	use ic start and earlier application for bath cases to save computational time
DONE	Possibly repeat all prior cases using better ic (end July)
NOW    3. Then, repeat 20hz vs theta, create signature (end July, begin Aug)
    4. Multi-spine sims - spatial specificity (after signature and good IC) (Aug, while away)
    5. Other questions:
       a. role of ACh during burst or pause or rebound? - repeat sims without ACh modulation
       b. confirm role of CamKII phos Dgl? - repeat sims without pDgl
       c. Can molecules substitute for others in signature? - repeat sims as above
    5. parameter robusteness

2016 Aug 1:
######## using higher PP2A dephos of D32p34PP1 and slower dephos of AKAR3, and bug fixed neurord3.1.3
>>>>>>>> nostim using restart: basal remains the same (GREAT)
	 noACh: Gi decreases to ~zero in ~35 sec.  This is a bit slow.  Would need GAP activity (RGS) to see an effect of pauses during theta or 20Hz.
	 Gi decrease produces transient cAMP elevation and D32p34 elevation.  Saturates, then decreases to ~2.5 uM.  Remains slightly elevated.
	 cAMP transient produced by increase in PDE activity via PKA phosphorylation.  pPP2A transient actually works against reduction in d32p34 because the phos form only acts on D32p75.
---> REPEAT WITH TRIALS=3
	 
>>>>>>>>>> Da stim sims with lower AKAR3 inject
AKAR3: 3.0 uM
D32p34PP1: 380-400 nM (slight dec, due to AKAR3?)
GsaGTP: minimal difference between 0.1 and 0.3s
cAMP: small difference between 0.1 and 0.3s, slightly bigger increment with 1s, much larger increment with 10s
cAMP: 350, 544, 900, 7100: too small a difference with brief stim, especially 0.3 and 1s needs larger peak/duration
pAKAR3: similar too small difference among the briefer Da stimuli.
	Decay rate from 10s stim is ~120 s (2 min) though not yet to basal
PKA activity very sensitive to small increases in cAMP, e.gl increase to 500 nM cAMP will produce large increase in phosphorylation of DARPP and AKAR, likely because minimal increase in phosphatase activity.
---> REPEAT WITH TRIALS=3

>>>>>>>>>> Bath and block sims
D32p34PP1 basal between 682-750, flat
CyA free = 8 uM (goal 5 uM), PP2B bound =  1 uM, free = 10 nM.  Rest of PP2B is CamCa2 or Cam bound.  Should CyA bind to those?  If so, would have less CyA free.
OA free ~0.8 uM - slightly low.  Increase inject quantity (duration) by 20%
PP1 free = 800, bound=2700 - this is blocking MORE than stated by NISHI
PP2A free =0 - all is bound, so no need to increase OA inject
--------> NO CHANGE OA INJECT, reduce CyA inject
>>>>>>>Very similar to experiments, though D32p34 changes too quickly (< 30 sec):
                 basal/stim Dp34  goal     basal/stim Dp75 goal         assessment
        Da       700/4.8u          5x      9.8u/6.5u   50%             BOTH goals met, though Dp75 reduction too small
        Ca       749n/427         50%      9.7u/6.4u   75%             BOTH goals met, though Dp75 reduction too big
        DaCa     683n/3.4u      50% of Da  9.9u/5.0u                   BOTH goals met, though Dp34 dec is too brief

	CyA:     700/700      	3-17x      9.8u/10.2u  100%            No effect on D32p34PP1!!!
        OA:      700/900       	1.3x,5x    9.8u/49.7        3x         Huge increase Dp75, reasonable inc Dp34, but transient!  pPDE increase a bit, which may slightly lower cAMP and PKA activity
        CyA+Ca   723/1.4u                   9.6u/10.0u           	CyA converts Ca decrement to Ca increment
        CyA+Da   713/4.8u                   9.8u/10.3u			Dp34 inc no greater than Da alone
------> Why does CyA not change D32p34?  Why does OA produce only transient increase in D32p34??
	If pPDE was dephos by a different PP, might not see increaes in pPDE, which would reduce basal cAMP, PKAc and Dp34.
---> REPEAT WITH TRIALS=3

>>>>>>>>Theta/20Hz
Injection not working - probably due to duration of stim being shorter than period.  THis was changed, and in the stimtest model it is working.
---> REPEAT WITH TRIALS=3
>>>>> PKAc and Dp34 similar between 20 Hz and theta
      PKc activity higher for theta (vs 20Hz)
      CapDgl is higher for theta, but so is CaDgl, same goes for Dag bound form (because greater calcium).  Result is similar 2ag for theta and 20hz.
      CKCam and CKpCam is much higher for theta.
      GiaGTP does not show pauses in ACh - probably Gi degradation is too slow.
      AC5GsaGiaATP is greater for 20Hz than theta, due to slightly higher Gs?
      Pauses in GiaGTP not seen following ACh bursts, only during pause alone.
      What if no rebound burst at all?  Or pause after burst?

#################
      a. Repeat sims with fix in stim files to avoid the pauses once stim has ceased
      b. stimulate without rebound, resume basal ACH at same time - 3.2 sec after initial burst
      c. Lengthen pause (keeping rebound) to 8s.

>>>>>>> No rebound sims ran, but not the others
NoRebound: 2AG initially has higher peaks with theta, but then peaks decrease as pDgl builds up.  So, theta has slightly lower 2ag, and CaMKII phos seems to be working.  PkcCaDag has slightly higher peaks for theta initially, and much higher peaks as pDgl builds up, diverting Dag to Pkc.
Lack of rebound does not allow the Gi dips to be visible.
AC5 is higher for 20hz, but AC1 is higher for theta.  20hz wins because AC5 dominates.
--------> Re-run other sims (with longer pause), and also the 20um morph cases (1 trial each)
Using the ACH with rebound firing.  Will need to repeat the 20 um morph using longer pause or no rebound it that works "better"

>>>>>>>>> Block-bath sims didn't work - corrupt header
      
&&&&&&& CONSIDER:
1. 5x faster CamKII phos of DagL (going back to higher pDagL activity) if still insufficient 2ag suppression
2. faster Gi production and degradation to see better Gi modulation
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
   
&&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

Still need to evaluate the following:
1. Chuhma et al., 2014: 10 ms time constant for action of activated G proteins -> may need faster G protein production (and degradation).  Currently G protein production is considerably slower than DaD1RGs binding?
