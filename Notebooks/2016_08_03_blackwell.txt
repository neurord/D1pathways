&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS:
DONE    1. Validate the nostim and ACh depletion cases. Da durations (Castro) with lower ACh during Da stim
DONE    2. bath and block cases for final tuning
DONE    	use ic start and earlier application for bath cases to save computational time
DONE	Possibly repeat all prior cases using better ic (end July)
NOW    3. Then, repeat 20hz vs theta, create signature (end July, begin Aug)
NOW    4. Multi-spine sims - spatial specificity (after signature and good IC) (Aug, while away)
    5. Other questions:
NOW       a. role of ACh during burst or pause or rebound? - repeat sims without ACh burst (already doing no rebound)
NOW       b. confirm role of CamKII phos Dgl? - repeat sims without pDgl - first need effective pDgl
NOW       c. Can molecules substitute for others in signature? - sims with altered Ca or CaMKII, etc - evaluate signature
    5. parameter robusteness

>>>>>>> Long Morphology sims
1. ACh stimultion looks a bit strange.  No rebound for some cases, too much dip towards end of 20Hz
2. Once again, PKAc greater for 20hz, CKpCam greater for theta
3. 2 spines theta has greater CKpCam than 1sp theta or 20hz, adjacent slightly greater than separated
4. Pkc is greater for theta than 20hz, but levels are quite low.  What approach could increase PKc without increasing 2ag basal?
------> increased 2ag degradation while increasing Dag (via rate or Plc quantity)
5. pDgl increases with the increase in CkpCamCa4, but little effect on 2ag because still only 10% of unphos.
5. No pause in Gi observed except at end with 6s pauses in ACh.  But observed pauses are much briefer.
-------->Increase rate of CKpCamCa4 phos of Dgl? 2-5x
-------->re-run short and/or long morph without ACh rebound? eliminate rebound burst
-------->accelerate production AND degradation of Gi to improve pause? 2-5x?
	    Would need to accelerate (10x) forward and backward rate of ACh binding to Gim4R and Gi binding to AChm4R

1. output of the short morphology sims - READY

###### Theta and 20hz simulations with
       2x CKpCamCa4 phos of Dgl and CaDgl
       4x production AND degradation of Gi
       uses the no rebound stim file
       ****** Rxn_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_Gifast.xml
       Model_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_Gifast-stimthetaNoReb.xml
       Model_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_Gifast-stim20hzNoReb.xml
       If these look better, will need to repeat all bath, block and Da sims with new params

>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. Discovered bug in 20Hz sims.  Part of Da stim was beginning at 50s instead of 20s - repeat all of these
2. NoRebound and 8s pause have only small effect on cAMP.  Both no rebound and 8s pause similarly increase D32p34 for theta(~200 nM inc), but 8s pause 300 nM inc with 20Hz, and small but noisy inc in CKpCam
3. Gifast-nostim: basal cAMP slightly lower 31 vs 51 nM; PKAc is lower: 4 vs 5 nM; D32p34 is lower: 635 vs 899
These low values are still reasonable.
4. the theta and 20hz did not run - need to repeat those sims, add in the rebound for comparison
       
&&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim
