To DO:
Select best Gi/Gs hydrolysis; do full set of sims with new params and create new figures
Determine how to account for Gq block of CaL, and controlling ACh timing
Determine how to account for alcohol
Determine what else could be controlling PKA
       	  
Goals: 1. cAMP returns to basal by end of simulation (during Da dur simulations)
       2. Gi decreases faster during mAChR dip
       3. Good cAMP basal - may need a few more sets of parameters for this
       4. better D32p34PP1 during DaCa - not as important, but evaluate these anyway
       5. Better dip during theta or 20hz

     		      	cAMP basal/300s		Dp34	Dp34 for basal Bath Da, DaCa
A: 4/sec, 0.4/sec 	29/39	15		600	     847/969	4.4u	1.5u 
D: 2/sec, 0.2/sec	27/40	15		443	     673/765	4.4u	1.5u	     
E: 1/sec, 0.1/sec	21/33	20		400	     618/751	4.3u	1.3u 

A: Gi hydrolysis is too fast. too high D32p34 basal and rebound after bath DaCa
E: basal cAMP a bit low, with lower DaCa?
D: good basal, good stimulated.  Better detection of 0.1, 0.3 stimuli , because D32p34PP1 exceeds 3 uM, thus PP1 inhibition is slikely effective

Theta vs 20hz: Now theta clearly has LESS D32p34PP1 than 20hz!  Same for cAMP.  So, these parameters suggest that PKAc is good for 20hz but not theta.  UNLESS, PKAc does something to hinder Pkc but not 2ag? Try the following:
A. Longer ACh pause for Theta
B. Lower Da for subsequent bursts for 20hz

Plan:
ready 1. Use GapD and repeat all "tuning" and Uchi sims
ready 2. Use GapD and repeat theta vs 20hz
ready 3. Use GapD and try theta with long pause, 20hz with less Da
ready 4. Use GapD and try theta and 20hz with delayed dopamine, and theta long pause ,and 20hz low Da with delayed dopamine
5. Select a subset of items 3&4 and perform the block cases

6. Add in RGS4 (only for D2 neurons?): hydrolysis of both Gq and Gi:
   Kreitzer shows that a. elevated cAMP or PKA blocks LTD in D2 neurons
   	    	       b. elevated PKA enhances RGS4 which lowers Gq
   Others show that RGS4 hydrolyzes BOTH Gq and Gi
   	       RGS4 does not diffuse

   Implementation:
      RGS4+PKAc <->complex -> pRGS4 -> RGS4    tune back and for to have low basal, and minimal PKAc diversion
      RGS4+Gi /Gq GTP <-> complex -> Gi/Gq GDP
      	      rates: lower spontaneous rates (currently 0.1 for Gq and 2 for Gi), e.g. 10x
	      	     Gq hydrolysis=0.01, with pRGS4, make Gq hydrolysis 1?  up to 5, will be limited by RGS4 quantity
		     Gi hyrolysis =0.2, with pRGS4, make Gi hydrolysis 1, up to 5 - same as for Gq?
	Phosphatidic acid inhibits RGS4
	RGS4 + PA <-> complex, IC50=4 uM
	This will prevent RGS4 from being phosphorylated by PKA.  Alternatively PA can bind pRGS4.
    Adjust rates and RGS4 quantity to maintain G prot basal levels and low pRGS4 - might need more than 10x slower spont rates
    Evaluate whether pRGS4 is more limiting of 2ag versus Pkc versus location of RGS4 - this might better occur if RGS4 is in dendrite, instead of spine, since Pkc is higher in spine where calcium is so high?

D32p34 ratio looks good, but why is basal so low???  All three Da trials are lower than the single trial done previously.
Time for cAMP to reach basal is 50-100 sec, so basal was not being observed previously.
########## Increase Gi hydrolysis to 4/sec, 0.4/sec

Initial DaDelay simulations:  AC5GsaATP is considerably slower than GsaGTP or AC5GsaGiaATP signal, so that the 600 ms delay is being lost.  Affinity (but not speed) is from Chen-Goodspeed; current Gi binding is 4x faster than Gs.
####### Increase Gs binding rate by 4x.  This shouldn't affect basal, but will produce higher stimulation cAMP and pAKAR3, etc.

Consider: make PKA binding to AKAR3 faster - will that allow the 10s to saturate pAKAR, and enhance 1s relative to 10s?  No - the increase takes 90 sec, which agrees with measurements.
What about lowering AKAR3 concentration?  That will reduce the competition with Darpp, etc.  Would that allow saturation?  Reconsider these after increased Gs binding rate. - would only need to re-run the Da dur sims with different AKAR injection

Previous Uchi sim results
    	 dhpg0	1      5	25		ratios:
100m	 -133	799    1738 	3958		not defined, but would be huge
1s	 598	2146   4009	6063		3.6 6.7	10.1
5s	 2090	4745   8889	10712		2.3 4.2	5.12

Good, but how does it compare to previous?  Probably a little worse for the 5s.
