>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Evaluate effect of tolerance versus simulation results:
Tol=0.002 is similar to tol=0.001 - neither have the strange increase in AC5Gsa.
All have very high peak cAMP  - so increased PDE2 is required.
Try 4x (or more?) increase in PDE2

Sim time vs tolerance:
.01 	19 hours
.005 1d 1.5 hours
.002 1d 11 hours
.001 2d 6 hours

---------------> Perform small set of simulations with higher PDE2 using 0.002 tolerance


SIGNATURE:  treat PKA targets differently than Pkc and CKpCam?
	    Issues: Normalization or weight?  Normalize to maximum over all paradigms?  Weight epac differently than Pkc?
	    Divide instead of subtract 2ag?  Have 4 thresholds: LTD vs LTP and spine vs dendrite?
	    To implement the latter, make 4 different graphs, add in threshold line?
