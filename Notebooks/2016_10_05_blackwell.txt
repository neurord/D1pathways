&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS (once model tuning finished):
    1. 20hz vs theta, create signature 
    2.  Multi-spine sims - spatial specificity
    3. Other questions:
       a. role of ACh during burst or pause or rebound? - repeat sims without ACh burst 
       b. confirm role of CamKII phos Dgl? - repeat sims without pDgl 
       c. Can molecules substitute for others in signature? - sims with altered Ca or CaMKII, etc - evaluate signature
       d. alcohol effects
    6. parameter robusteness

---------> PP2B dephos is ineffective.
#######iupdate Rx file with higher affinity of Pp2B dephos of D32p34 kf=4.0e-3 -> 1.25 uM, 60% greater:
******Rxn_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_GiGsfast.xml
******Model_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_GiGsfast-nostim.xml
#######iinject half the OA to decrease block of PP2A and prevent saturation of Dp75
NISHI: cyclosporin: 5 uM, OA: 1 uM
NISHI: OA blocks ~100% of PP2A but only 30% of PP1.
Free PP2A drops from 1.1 uM each to ~200 nM each (80% block)
Free PP1 drops from 2.8 uM to ~1.8 uM - so block is a bit too weak, though working quite nice.

&&&&If D32p34 is now too low, decrease the PP2A dephos rates to enhance effect of PP2B block
Else, if good, repeat DaDur and various LTP/LTD sims and update spreadsheet with new rates
Also, add in block m1 receptor (kf for binding =0), or mGluR receptor (stim file ready with new reaction).
Also block m4 receptor (kf for binding =0) to make prediction, and block m4 and no Da burst to see if compensates.

>>>>>>>>> 10/4/2016 Results 
basal Dp34 ~800 nM
OA: much better response - small increase D32p34, big increase in Dp75
Bath Ca: ~60% reduction in Dp34
CyA: small increase in D32p34 - need still more
#######increase kf to 5e-6, and kb & kcat by 50% for PP2B.  Km=1.5 uM (close to measured) kcat is 50% greater
This is more appropriate because Km are more precise measurements
>>>>>>>>>10/5/2015 Results WORSE!
#######increase all rates.  kf=6.3e-3, kb=8, kcat=2.  Km~1.6 uM, kcat is 2x greater than original

>>>>>>> 10/10/2016 Results
basal is 750-800 nM - still too high
bath:  Da produces large increase in Dp34 (>4 uM), reduced by Ca (2 uM peak for DaCa)
      Ca produces reduction: 246 minimum, ~400-450 prolonged - almost meets goal
block: CyA slowly increases Dp34 to 950 nM - still too weak

#####increase kf to 8e-3 (from 6.3e-3) for PP2B (Km=1.25 uM)
Regarding Gi dip: consider slowing down rate of Gia binding to AC5Gsa form, e.g. 10x 
##### Kf, kb=0.00125,0.2 (from 0.0125, 2) for Gia binds AC5Gsa
---------->Will this improve the pAKAR results?

MGluR results: trivial effect on Gq, 2ag, Pkc from blocking it.  Gq bound Plc is ~5% of ca bound Plc
That could be due to much faster plc activity with Gq bound (~60x faster kcat, 30x faster kf)
OR, could be due to greater m1R contribution?  YES: no ACh reduces GqaGTP drastically (from 35 nM to 10 nM.  noMGlu only reduces it from 35 nM to 30 nM
---------->Re-assess quantity of bound receptor for mGluR vs AChR after next set of sims

>>>>>>>>>10/11/2016
crazy high basal quantity of D32p34PP1 - cAMP also is high.  This is caused by the slow Gi binding?
GiaGTP values are similar, but AC5Gsa is a bit higher now (5 vs 2), AC5GsaGia is lower 75 vs 86, and AC5GsaATP is higher (30 vs 20).
Solution: go back to fast Gi binding, or
	  increase ACh quantity?  ACh will increase Gq basal, or
	  increase m4R - ACh affinity - already at outer end of published
	  increase speed of AChR binding Gi (kf &kb) - currently too low given kcat
	   
####### AChR binding Giabg: from 0.096,1.68 to 0.129,3.35; from 0.01824,10 to 0.0365,20
----->If Gi is higher (currently 33), but cAMP still too high (currently 121) go back to fast Gi binding to AC5; Consider adding Gs binding 2nd, to that Gs can come off first also.  
	 cAMP good/low values: AC5Gia   469.18, AC5GsaGiaATP    92.76, AC5GsaATP    12.33
	 cAMP too high values: AC5Gia   464.5, AC5GsaGiaATP    74.07, AC5GsaATP    35.24
----->If Gi is now fine, but still no dip effect visible, go back to previous, or even faster Gi dissocation, and add in Gs binding 2nd (according to Dessauer)

>>>>>>>>>10/13/2016
Da dur: no discrimination of different durations, basal cAMP still too high
GiaGTP: still 33; AC5GsaATP: 38 - too high, AC5GsaGiaATP: 67 - too low
D32p34 - crazy high (> 2 uM) basal
-----------> go back to previous values for Gia binding.  Keep the updated PP2B values
----------> add in Gs binding to AC5Gia complex - which allows GsaGTP to come off first
	    What if AC5 needed two Gs/Golf to bind for activity?
	    What if second G binding had lower affinity? - lower Gs binding to ACGi would compensate lowe Gi binding to ACGs?
theta/20hz-noReb: no dip detected. GiaGTP dip possibly smaller than previous rates.

>>>check total molecules and adjust before re-running
1. Cam is 70 too high (both in nostim and in spreadsheet)- reduce the Cam form by 70
2. Darpp is to high by 65 - reduce the D32p75 form by 65
3. PP2B is 16 too low, but is fine in spread sheet - must be stochastic, though larger than most discrepancies
>>>>Adjusted/updated diffusion constants - based on MW and viscosity.  Still need to update CamKII based on direct measurement

############# Rxn_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_GiGsfast.xml, Previous AC5-Gi parameters, but with Gs binding 2nd, and 2x lower affinity.
Gs binds to AC5Gia complex, kf=0.0037, kb=2: kb 2x higher (affinity 3x lower) than for Gs to AC5
Gi binding to AC5Gs complex: kb inc to 4: 2x higher than for Gi to AC5

>>>>>>>>>> Cam: 8978, Darpp:49993, PP2B: 4984 - within random variation, or am I missing a form?
basal: Dp34: 1463 (too high) Dp75: 8728 (too low).
AC5GsaATP=22.6 - in between, AC5GsaGsiATP: 96 - good.  cAMP: 80 - too high
---------_>Go back to higher affinity Gi binding to AC5Gs, but keep both pathways (which should not affect basal).

>>>>>>>>>>Results 10/17/2016
GiaGTP: 34; AC5GsaATP: 16 (vs 12), AC5GsaGiaATP: 111 (vs 92) - much better
cAMP basal: ~50, PKAc = 5, D32p34PP1=832, D32p75=9484
These are still a bit high, though acceptable.  What if two Gs molecules needed to bind for activity?  That would definitely decrease the cAMP production at basal.  Alternatively (easier? increase PDE by 10-20%).

&&&&To simulate no m1 or no m4: once reaction rates are settled, set kf=0 for ACh + m1R/m4R and m1RGq/m4RGi (two rxn files, simulated with each of 2 stim files).  

Response to bath application (GiGsfast):
   	Dp34tot	  goal		Dp75	goal				Da	pAKAR3
basal	820-860	  500 nM	9500	10-12 uM			0.1	1.1
Da	4460	  5x  		6413	50%				0.3	1.3
Ca	300n	  50%		6280	25%				1	1.65
DaCa	1511	  2-3x		4976	unknown				10	2.7
CyA:	1040	  3-17x		9584	no change
OA:	1350n	  5x		36.7u	3x
----------> basal a bit high due to high PKAc, insufficient response to CyA
	    increase PDE4 to lower PKAc (this will not necessarily increase the response to CyA)
----------> Da duration: discrimation between 0.1 and 0.3 Da, but 1 s is not saturating
pPDE going up, but not very fast. PKAc increases very quickly - NOT TRUE
rates of PKAc phos:
DaD1RGs: .0008, .08, .03
PDE10:	 .00025	.024 .006
PDE4:	 .00025	.08  .02
pp2a:	 .0025	.37  .05       
D32:	 .0027	8    2
AKAR:	 .00625	0.75 0.1875
10s has larger and longer duration PKAc than 1s.  Possibly the 1s stimuli in Castro was longer, and long enough to saturate the PKAc?

Signature: dendrite/spine (CkpCam+PkcCaDag+Pkac)  	       	2ag dend only
   	 norebound    noCKp	  noACh burst    noMGlu		noreb    noCKp	  noACh   noMGlu
20hz      10.9/14.2   8.1/12.6	  10.3/16.3	 10.6/12.3	12.3	 13.2	  8.2	  11.4
theta	  23.2/24.4   7.5/10.1	  20.5/23.4	 23.3/23.7	9.1	 11.6	  6.5	  8.2
ratio of LTP sig to 2ag (dendrite):
20hz  	  0.89 	      0.61	   1.26		0.92
theta	  2.54	      0.64	   3.15		2.84

noCKp definitely reduces signature of theta to below that of 20hz - convert to LTD, possibly enhanced LTD with 20 hz
noACh burst reduces 2ag quantity third (expected), reduces dendritic signature by ~20%
-------> actually enhances LTP signature!  this is different than an m1 or m4 block
	 Also, this doesn't take into account effect of Gqbg on calcium signal
noMGlu - trivial effect on spine signature for theta, small effect for 20hz, despite doubling the Gq in the spine head to 4 uM, and doubling the MgluR to 400. 
----------->This does not agree with experiments.  What about Uchigashima simulations?  Do we need to lower Plc affinity for calcium to make Gq more important?

############ New simulations with higher PDE concentration (should still have issues with noMGlu)
20% because even 20% smaller Dp34 is still on the large side
PDE4=336 (330/6 vs 275/5)
PDE2=672 (vs 560)
PDE10=840 (720/120 vs 620/80 neck, 680/160 vs 580/120 head, 294/42 vs 245/35 dend)

long simulations are running - ~70 sec in 24 hours -> 4 days for simulations.  Started on 10/17 in morning, should finish 10/21.  Entire set of short simulations takes ~2 days -> Begin the new nostim case on 10/21, should be finished by 10/23 - ready to evaluate by 10/24.  Repeat long simulations if new parameters are better.  Possibly tweak Gq first to match Uchigashima.

Response to bath application (GiGsfast):
   	Dp34tot	  goal		Dp75	goal				Da	pAKAR3
basal	676-680	  500 nM	9750	10-12 uM			0.1	0.82
Da	4416	  5x  		6295	50%				0.3	0.89
Ca	260n	  50%		6666	25%				1	1.2
DaCa	1443	  2-3x		4935	unknown				10	2.6
CyA:	795	  3-17x		10.0	no change
OA:	1105n	  5x		34.2u	3x
------------> basal MUCH better, da duration still not saturating with 1s.
	      great response to Da, Ca, Da+Ca, OA bath
	      Transient increase in Dp34 wit CyA block - still not sufficient!
PP2BCamCa4 levels are not altered by CyA block - what is inject value?
CyA=8 uM, CyA_PP2B = 1 uM, free PP2B ~8 nM, Dp34PP1 bound PP2B ~4 nM - these are same values as without CyA!
CyA affinity is 50 nM, but these are possible values for IC50: Tocris: 5 nM; Oetjen .. Knepel 2005 - 10 nM; Groblewski, Wagner, Williams - 65 nM.
This means that affinity is way to low.  Increase affinity 10x (but reduce quantity by 30%) and re-run ONLY THIS ONE.

Theta & 20 hz: noACh has higher D32p34
ACh burst (vs no ACh) delays the increase in AC5GsaATP, but the small transient dips in GiaGTP do not produce small transient bursts of AC5GsaATP.  On the other hand, the early increase in AC5GsaATP produces slightly higher cAMP and PKAc in those conditions, with slightly higher D32p34.  However, these changes aren't huge, and are similar for theta and 20 hz
noMGlu and noACh: no ACh yields significantly (20%?) less Dag, and thus less 2ag and Pkc active. Effect on Pkc only appears for theta, not 20hz.

############# 50 nM affinity, lower injection of CyA:
<Reaction name="CyAblock" id="CyAblock">
    <Reactant specieID="CyA"/>
    <Reactant specieID="PP2BCamCa4"/>
    <Product specieID="CyA_PP2B"/>
	<forwardRate>0.001e-3</forwardRate>
	<reverseRate>0.005e-3</reverseRate>
>>>>>>> CyA=6 uM free, CyA_PP2B=3.2 uM, PP2BCamCa4 dec to 2 nM free, 2 nM Dp34 bound
Dp34PP1 increases a bit - remains close to 800 nM.  Still not sufficient.  Try 1 nM affinity.
>>>>>> Dp34 = 866 nM - still less than 2fold increase, only slightly greater than 50 nM affinity.
The decrease in PP2B is slow - may need to simulate for longer to observe maximum increase.


Alternative approach to detecting Gi dip
1. AC5 has some GAP activity against Gs, but what if AC5 had GAP activity against Gi?
Make short simulation to evaluate basal, then if good evaluate Da stim sims
GapGs: 25 sec of "control"
GapGiA: Gi gap instead of Gs gap with same value of 0.01/sec
GapGiB: same gap activity of A, but double rate of Gi production to compensate: AChR binding Giabg: from 0.096,1.68 to 0.192,3.35; from 0.01824,10 to 0.0365,20, and GiGTP synthesis double from 4 to 8
Goals: AC5GsaGiaATP    92.76, AC5GsaATP    12.33.  GiaGTP: 34  Then see if dip is detected

>>>>>>>>>>Results 10/27/16
			cAMP	GiaGTP	AC5GsaATP	AC5GsaGiaATP	
GapGs (ctrl) 	      	30	34	11		97
GapGiA is not good	49	34	18		105
GapGiB: good   		33	63	12		113

These are results after 25 sec.  Clearly GapGiA has too much cAMp and AC5GsaATP.  GapGiB is promixing - needs to be simulated longer
Try nostim for 500 sec - new basal
Try theta - is gap detected

------->A) Research effects of alcohol.
	   investigate something abot plasticity and alcohol
	B) What stimulation protocol would optimize LTP?
	   According to Reynolds - burst of Da needs to be AFTER ACh burst, e.g. by 0.6 sec.  Adjust theta stim file to achieve this.

&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

For publication, do we simulate a D2R model?  Or alcohol effects?
