&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS (once model tuning finished):
    1. 20hz vs theta, create signature 
    2.  Multi-spine sims - spatial specificity
    3. Other questions:
       a. role of ACh during burst or pause or rebound? - repeat sims without ACh burst 
       b. confirm role of CamKII phos Dgl? - repeat sims without pDgl 
       c. Can molecules substitute for others in signature? - sims with altered Ca or CaMKII, etc - evaluate signature
       d. alcohol effects
    6. parameter robusteness

---------> PP2B dephos is ineffective.
#######iupdate Rx file with higher affinity of Pp2B dephos of D32p34 kf=4.0e-3 -> 1.25 uM, 60% greater:
******Rxn_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_GiGsfast.xml
******Model_SPNspineAChm4R_Gshydr5_AC1_GiGsfast-nostim.xml
#######iinject half the OA to decrease block of PP2A and prevent saturation of Dp75
NISHI: cyclosporin: 5 uM, OA: 1 uM
NISHI: OA blocks ~100% of PP2A but only 30% of PP1.
Free PP2A drops from 1.1 uM each to ~200 nM each (80% block)
Free PP1 drops from 2.8 uM to ~1.8 uM - so block is a bit too weak, though working quite nice.

&&&&If D32p34 is now too low, decrease the PP2A dephos rates to enhance effect of PP2B block
Else, if good, repeat DaDur and various LTP/LTD sims and update spreadsheet with new rates
Also, add in block m1 receptor (kf for binding =0), or mGluR receptor (stim file ready with new reaction).
Also block m4 receptor (kf for binding =0) to make prediction, and block m4 and no Da burst to see if compensates.

>>>>>>>>> Results
basal Dp34 ~800 nM
OA: much better response - small increase D32p34, big increase in Dp75
Bath Ca: ~60% reduction in Dp34
CyA: small increase in D32p34 - need still more
#######increase kf to 5e-6, and kb & kcat by 50%.  Km=1.5 uM (close to measured) kcat is 50% greater
This is more appropriate because Km are more precise measurements
>>>>>>>>>Results WORSE!
#######increase all rates.  kf=6.3e-3, kb=8, kcat=2.  Km~1.6 uM, kcat is 2x greater than original
>>>>>>>basal is 750-800 nM - still too high
>>>>>>>bath:  Da produces large increase in Dp34 (>4 uM), reduced by Ca (2 uM peak for DaCa)
	      Ca produces reduction: 246 minimum, ~400-450 prolonged - almost meets goal
>>>>>>block: CyA slowly increases Dp34 to 950 nM - still too weak

#####increase kf to 8e-3 (from 6.3e-3) (Km=1.25 uM)
Regarding Gi dip: consider slowing down rate of Gia binding to AC5Gsa form, e.g. 10x 
##### Kf, kb=0.00125,0.2 (from 0.0125, 2)
Will this improve the pAKAR results?

MGluR results: trivial effect on Gq, 2ag, Pkc from blocking it.  Gq bound Plc is ~5% of ca bound Plc
That could be due to much faster plc activity with Gq bound (~60x faster kcat, 30x faster kf)
OR, could be due to greater m1R contribution?  YES: no ACh reduces GqaGTP drastically (from 35 nM to 10 nM.  noMGlu only reduces it from 35 nM to 30 nM
Re-assess quantity of bound receptor for mGluR vs AChR after next set of sims

&&&&To simulate no m1 or no m4: once reaction rates are settled, set kf=0 for ACh + m1R/m4R and m1RGq/m4RGi
(two rxn files, simulated with each of 2 stim files).  

Response to bath application (GiGsfast):
   	Dp34tot	  goal		Dp75	goal
basal	1.2	  500 nM		10-12 uM
Da		  5x  			50%
Ca	688n	  50%		6100	25%
DaCa	3300n	  2-3x		4970	??
CyA:		  3-17x			no change
OA:		  5x			3x

   	 norebound  noCKp	  noACh burst	       norebound  noCKp	  noACh burst
20hz      10.4	     7.1	  9.1		       11.5	  13.9	  7.6
theta	  22.0	     6.2	  22.2		       8.1	  12.4	  5.3
ratio of LTP sig to 2ag:
20hz  	  0.9 	    0.5		1.2
theta	  2.7	    0.5		4.2  

-------------->Research effects of alcohol.  What stimulation protocal would optimize LTP?

&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

For publication, do we simulate a D2R model?  Or alcohol effects?
