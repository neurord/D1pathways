&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause - repeat sims without ACh burst 
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

		 6. alcohol effects, parameter robusteness

11/18/2016: using new, NeuroRD (slower reactions)
>>>>>>>>>>>Results of Da duration
1. Da reaches 16 uM because pumps are slower
2. cAMP is lower
3. PKAc is lower
4. phosphorylation of AKAR3 and D32p34PP1 are slower - the latter is good as it occurs to quickly
--------------> inject less dopamine or speed up decay.
>>>>>>>>>>>Results of bath application
1. Da reaches 17 uM
2. calcium reaches 2.3 uM (not necessarily bad)
3. D32p75 decreases to 5.4 uM with Ca alone
4. maximal Da effect takes 1-2 minutes to develop (this is good).
5. Basal D32p34PP1 is too low.
----------> slightly lower PP2A
>>>>>>>>>>>Results of block application
1. CyA block increases D32p34PP1 to ~0.8 uM - great increase. HOWEVER, this appears to be due to slow increase in cAMP.
fix this by: reducing affinity of AC5GsaGia for ATP, which grows steadily during OA block, possibly due to fast increase in GiaGTP
2. OA block increases D32p34PP1 to 400 nM - smaller - showing less effective.

>>>>>>>>>>Overall
ACh basal is 75; basal Gi is 100, basal Gs < 1, basal AC5GsATP is 5-10
Basal cAMP is far too low.  This explains the low D32p34
1. Da basal: fine. Keep ratio of Kf to Kb for Da to DaOut, double rates to lower Da peaks.
2. STIM FILES: Increase Da inject for shorter pulses, decrease (delay to 100 ms) Da inject for longer pulses)
3. increase basal cAMP: reduce PDEs

############### NEW PARAMETERS:
Da to DaOut Kf=2e-3, Kb=0.11e-6/msec
PDE4 conc = 275,5; PDE2=560, PDE10=620,80 head; 580,120 neck; 245,35 dend
Da stim: 500 for first 10 msec, wait until 100msec and then turn on prolonged stim.
Speed up AKAR dephosphorylation (phosphorylation will speed up with higher PKAc)
Run all simulations longer - to 300s, prolong basal ACH stim?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Results
1. cAMP now too high - go partway back to higher PDEs?  Not yet
2. Da is pretty good, tweak to be a bit higher ->
   increase inject from 390 to 500 for 10s (forgot previously)
   Increase rate of DaDbuf dissociation - currently rises too slowly for uncaging (0.1 s trial reaches peak at 0.2 s).
3. Stimulated cAMP is too low!  Production of Gs leads to large AC5GsaGiaATP, and much smaller AC5GsaATP -> reduce affinity of Gia for Gs bound form (and vice versa?).  E.g. faster Gi dissociation from Gs bound form, (but also will need to slow Gs binding to Gi bound form, or speed Gs dissociation from Gi bound form.
Why does Da-Ca produce MUCH higher  cAMP than Da alone?  AC1 is now quite active.  This is OK.
4. Both GsaGTP and GiaGTP are higher and slightly increasing
previous values for good cAMP: AC5Gia   469.18 , AC5GsaGiaATP    92.76, AC5GsaATP    12.33
Current values                 AC5Gia: ~470      AC5GsaGiaATP    >500!!, AC5GsaATP  20
suggests too much Gi and Gs, though still not enough Gq!
a. Lower Gq hydrolysis
b. lower Gi and Gs production rates, or increase hydrolysis rates (or both).
5. During theta or 20 hz: AChm1RGq exceeds 200 during peaks, but GluMgluRGq only reachs 10, so of  course blocking it will not do anything. GluMgluRGq reaches 200 IN THE SPINE HEAD, but of course this structure is so small that the overall amount is too small.  Only 1-2 molecules of Gq bound Plc observed during theta
Need to increase both amounts in the spine:MgluR and Gq

##############Summary/new parameters:
1. Increase rate DaDbuf dissociation.  Rates: from 10 to 20
2. Increase MgluR to 800 in spine, and Gqabg to 8000 in spine.  
3. Gi bind to AC5Gs: kf=0.0125	kb=6 (3x higher)
   	  Gs bind to AC5Gi: kf=0.0037	kb=2.997 (3x higher)
4. Change Galphai production: kcat =4.0 (from 8.0) - less basal and stimulated Gi
5. Change Galphas hydrolysis: to 1.0 (from 0.5) - less basal and stimulated Gs

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Results
1. Basal:
GsaGTP: 3   AC5Gia: ~480   AC5GsaGiaATP   160-180; AC5GsaATP  40; GqaGTP: 10; PlcGqTot: 4
Gq slightly higher, though still low
AC5GsaGiaATP is much better, though still a bit high.  AC5GsaATP too high
cAMP=160 - way too high
D32p34PP1=~2500 - way too high, but better than previous; D32p75= 7500 - too low
phospho PDEs increase  to 40 (PDE4) and 80 (PDE10), minimal pDaD1RGs, pPP2A>200 - possibly explaining the Dp75

2. Bath:
cAMP increases to 3.9 uM for Da and 2.4uM for Da+Ca - this is high enough that PDEs can be increased

PDE1CamCa4 is 1500, but only 300 bound to cAMP -> perhaps affinity or rates should be higher to enhance activity dependence over basal?

3. Da Stim: though basal is too high, the pAKAR3 distinguishes the 4 different durations
1 s of Da gives ~600 nM, 0.3s gives 395n, 0.1s =306n.  What should they be?

4. Block: Dp34 increases with both OA and CyA.  The CyA increases is much slower. CyA bound to PP2B increases quite slowly, though CyA itself goes up rapidly.  This is not necessarily wrong - expers show that block develops over minutes, but makes it difficult to see effect within 5 min.

5. Stim: Gq bound Plc is ~5% of Ca bound. Blocking ACh eliminates all of that, blocking mGluR blocks none of it, even with much higher mGluR and Gq in spine.  Because still only 1-2 molecules of PlcCaGqaPip2 in the spine.  Perhaps Plc is limiting, because only 400 nM total Plc in spine head?  Perhaps GqGTPase is too fast (given the GTPase activity of Plc?)

##############New parameters
1. Go back to higher PDEs - this is 20% higher than previous.  
2. Speed CyA binding by 2x to see effect with 300s.  Decrease OA binding rate so that it is not so much faster than CyA, and so that D32p75 increases more slowly.
3. Reduce GqaGTPase to 0.1 in absence of Plc (perhaps even 0.01).
4. Fix MGluR rate constants: A: Were violating PMR, B: Mukhopaday and Ross say that GDP can dissociate at 1.5/sec and is rate limiting.
  --> Faster kcat for Gq production
  --> higher affinity for Glu to bind to Gq bound mGluR (instead of lower)
  --> Need to adjust Glu binding to MgluRGq when adjusting Glu binding to MgluR alone

Evaluate:
A. cAMP and downstream: If cAMP is now too low, reduce to only 10% higher
B. Gq, Plc bound Gq, effect of MGluR stimulation: if too low, increase Plc quantity in the spine?
C. effect of Block - increase Dp34 with CyA?
D. Effect of dopamine duration: need PKA acceleration of Gap activity against Gi to get larger effect of 0.1s Da?  Or lower tonic ACh for these simulations?

***************************Discovered bug in IC assignment.  Not sure if any of the new parameter tuning is correct.
Re-do using old parameters.  BETTER, but a few things need fixing based on previous sims:
1. Increase rate DaDbuf dissociation.  Rates: from 10 to 20
2. Increase MgluR to 800 in spine, and Gqabg to 8000 in spine.  
3. Speed CyA binding by 2x to see effect with 300s.  Decrease OA binding rate so that it is not so much faster than CyA, and so that D32p75 increases more slowly.
4. Reduce GqaGTPase to 0.1 in absence of Plc (perhaps even 0.01).
5. Fix MGluR rate constants: A: Were violating PMR, B: Mukhopaday and Ross say that GDP can dissociate at 1.5/sec and is rate limiting.
  --> Faster kcat for Gq production
  --> higher affinity for Glu to bind to Gq bound mGluR (instead of lower)
  --> Need to adjust Glu binding to MgluRGq when adjusting Glu binding to MgluR alone
cAMP is still too high. Fix with
1. Gi bind to AC5Gs: kf=0.0125	kb=6 (3x higher) (compensate with Gs faster binding to AC5Gi)
2. Faster Gs hydrolysis

>>>>>>>>>>>> Basal - MUCH BETTER!
OLD:     GsaGTP: 3             AC5Gia: ~480  AC5GsaGiaATP 160-180                    AC5GsaATP  40; 
CURRENT: GsaGTP: 3 GiaGTP: 100 AC5Gia: ~580  AC5GsaGiaATP 250       AC5GsaGia: 5     AC5GsaATP  30
AC5GsaATP is better, but AC5GsaGiaATP is higher.
cAMP = 80
D32p34PP1=1434
D32p75=9000 due to pPP2A
-------->Need to lower cAMP a bit more
a. Even faster hydrolysis?
b. Higher PDEs?

>>>>>>>More Results
Bath application of Da, Ca yields peak cAMP < 1.5 uM.  If increase PDEs, this will decrease.
Da duration: peak cAMP is 1 uM for 10s of Da.  Peak < 400 nM for 1s Da.  At end of sim, ACh inject ceases early - cAMP increases to 3 uM (and then deceases to 2 uM)  -> this suggests that
A decrease in ACh during Da stim would allow greater cAMP with Da Dur, and could compensate for an increase in PDEs.
Da is too high.  Peak < 10 uM for 0.1 (needs to increase) but > 10 uM for other durations (decrease later stim).
-----------> Changes to parameters
1. increase PDE10 by 20% (decrease basal cAMP from 90 to 50), but minimize effect on stimulated
2. increase initial Da inject (from 390 to 450), and decrease later inject (from 5.7 to 5.0)
3. Decrease ACh (stop injection) during stimulation.  2s for 0.1 and 0.3 (~time for Da to decay to half), 4s for 1s; only 4 s for 10s Da -> assume adaptation occurs

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
With 20% higher PDE10:
mean cAMP=70
mean D32p34PP1=1.05 uM
------>GOOD, but not enough.
############# increase PDE4 by 20%

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Gs part: GsaGTP: 1 AC5Gsa=4 GiaGTP: 100 AC5Gia: 570  AC5GsaGiaATP 260       AC5GsaGia: 3     AC5GsaATP  34
cAMP, etc: cAMP=83 PKAc=6 D32p34PP1=1260
-------> Basal still too high.  The PDE4 increase did not help.  Go back to previous PDE4 and increase PDE10 still more.
Da Stim:
     cAMP	PKAc	pAKAR3	D32p34PP1	Da peak
0.1: 350	14	1167	2.4u		10u
0.3: 515	18	1288	2.6u		13u
1.0  1.2u	21	1442	2.9u		13.7u
10:  1.9u	30	2.0u	3.6u		14.2u
Nice increase with stimulation - ACh decrease is quite effective, reduce the prolonged Da stim still further
Bath:
cAMP: increases with Da to 1 uM, to 750 nM with Da+Ca
D32p34PP1 increases with Da, decreases with Ca or Da+Ca:
	  Not caused by too much PDE1cAMP activity since cAMP is still fine
	  Possibly due to excess PP2B activity; possibly due to high basal - do not reduce unless still remains with correct basal
Response to block:
	 D32p34PP1 increases with both CyA and OA -> higher with OA - therefore do not reduce PP2B activity.
	 Possibly eliminate PP2Acal activity

Theta/20hz stim:
      What is response to Glutamate stimulation?
      Basal 2ag, Dag, Ip3 a bit high.  Possibly increase rate of degradation of some or all.
      for 20hz: noMGlu has peak Gq=48 (vs 81  control) BUT, effect on Plc bound forms is trivial, small effect on PkcCaDag
      for theta: simulation did not run
Options:
	a. Small mGluR in dendritic submembrane
	b. lower affinity of Plc for Ca - to increase dependence on Gq - this will lower basal 2ag, Dag and Ip3
	Note that increased degradaion will not improve effect of mGluR block, but might be needed if mGluR in dend submemb
increased PDE10	to lower basal cAMP, lower Da stim

#################
Da stim - reduce prolonged from 5.0 to 4.0
PDEs: lower PDE4 back to previous, increase PDE10 another 20%
>>>>>>>>> no stim: much better, but still too high D32p34PP1
cAMP: 56
D32p34PP1: 994
D32p75: 9235
PKAc: 6.3
pPP2A: 104
pPDE10: 13
Gs part - no change: GsaGTP: 1 AC5Gsa=3.5 GiaGTP: 102 AC5Gia: 588  AC5GsaGiaATP 240      AC5GsaGia: 3     AC5GsaATP  27.4

------->increase PDE10 still more - will have less effect on stimulated than on basal since high affinity
D32p75 is too low:
A. decrease PP2A quantity - this could also raise D32p34PP1 quantity
B. decrease pPP2A via lower cAMP and PKAc - will probably not be enough
C. increase Cdk5
Note that the sharp decrease in Dp75 coincides with sharp increase in pPP2A, so probably do not need the Cdk5 increase

##############New parameters
PDE10=1244, 1175; PDE10cAMP=208,276 (previous: 1037, 979; 173, 230)

>>>>>>>>>>>Results, Bath
Better: cAMP similar, but Dp34 is lower and Dp75 is higher.  Still not enough.
Bath:	Da   	  Ca      DaCa
cAMP	652	  115	  1u
Dp34	3.7u	  1.5u	  2.8u - rebound peak.
------------>DaCa actually DECREASES Dp34, despite having the largest cAMP, possibly due to too strong PP2B, or due to too high a calcium during Ca stim.
>>>>>>>Results, block
OA block: D32p75 reaches > 30 uM within 30s
   D32p34 increases during 20 sec to 1.6 uM (almost double)
CyA block: D32p34 increases during 30 sec to 1.1 uM  - barely acceptable.

------------>
If PKA activity were lowered, likely blocking Pp2B would produce even smaller increase in Dp34.
Possibly could produce larger effect of Pp2B block if basal Pp2B were higher, i.e. if basal calcium were higher.  That may explain variability in results. Could simulate this with small continuous injection of calcium?
Perhaps live with this basal Dp34?

1. Need to reduce ACh during bath, e.g. for 10s, similar to the Dopamine duration sims
2. Reduce Da and Ca peak values - likely smaller effect on Da than on Ca
******StimDend_DaBath, StimDend_CaBath, StimDend_DaCaBath
Ca stim at 21s reduced from 6.9 to 5.0
Da stim reduced from 45 to 40 at 20s, from 6 to 4 at 100 ms and 1s
ACh paused for 10s at 20s
3. Reduce pPP2A by decreasing PKA activity for this molecule - presently kcat=0.06 for PP2a, vs 0.006 for PDE10
   will increase Dp75 and pPP2A, which might actually affect (reduce) Dp34
   Kf=0.0008, kb=0.12, kcat=0.02 - one third activity.  Can't reduce too much, else Da will not cause Dp75 decrease

Once basal is good, consider tuning phosphatase activity against D32p34, and the Gq pathways.  Is it necessary to have small mGluR in the dendrites?

------->A) Research effects of alcohol.
	   investigate something about plasticity and alcohol
	B) What stimulation protocol would optimize LTP?
	   According to Reynolds - burst of Da needs to be AFTER ACh burst, e.g. by 0.6 sec.  Adjust theta stim file to achieve this.
>>>Added in DaDelay case

&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

For publication, do we simulate a D2R model?  Or alcohol effects?
