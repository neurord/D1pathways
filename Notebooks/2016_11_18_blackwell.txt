&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause - repeat sims without ACh burst 
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

		 6. alcohol effects, parameter robusteness

>>>>>>>>>>>Results of Da duration
1. Da reaches 16 uM because pumps are slower
2. cAMP is lower
3. PKAc is lower
4. phosphorylation of AKAR3 and D32p34PP1 are slower - the latter is good as it occurs to quickly
--------------> inject less dopamine or speed up decay.
>>>>>>>>>>>Results of bath application
1. Da reaches 17 uM
2. calcium reaches 2.3 uM (not necessarily bad)
3. D32p75 decreases to 5.4 uM with Ca alone
4. maximal Da effect takes 1-2 minutes to develop (this is good).
5. Basal D32p34PP1 is too low.
----------> slightly lower PP2A
>>>>>>>>>>>Results of block application
1. CyA block increases D32p34PP1 to ~0.8 uM - great increase. HOWEVER, this appears to be due to slow increase in cAMP.
fix this by: reducing affinity of AC5GsaGia for ATP, which grows steadily during OA block, possibly due to fast increase in GiaGTP
2. OA block increases D32p34PP1 to 400 nM - smaller - showing less effective.

>>>>>>>>>>Overall
ACh basal is 75; basal Gi is 100, basal Gs < 1, basal AC5GsATP is 5-10
Basal cAMP is far too low.  This explains the low D32p34
1. Da basal: fine. Keep ratio of Kf to Kb for Da to DaOut, double rates to lower Da peaks.
2. STIM FILES: Increase Da inject for shorter pulses, decrease (delay to 100 ms) Da inject for longer pulses)
3. increase basal cAMP: reduce PDEs

############### NEW PARAMETERS:
Da to DaOut Kf=2e-3, Kb=0.11e-6/msec
PDE4 conc = 275,5; PDE2=560, PDE10=620,80 head; 580,120 neck; 245,35 dend
Da stim: 500 for first 10 msec, wait until 100msec and then turn on prolonged stim.
Speed up AKAR dephosphorylation (phosphorylation will speed up with higher PKAc)
Run all simulations longer - to 300s, prolong basal ACH stim?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Results
1. cAMP now too high - go partway back to higher PDEs?  Not yet
2. Da is pretty good, tweak to be a bit higher ->
   increase inject from 390 to 500 for 10s (forgot previously)
   Increase rate of DaDbuf dissociation - currently rises too slowly for uncaging (0.1 s trial reaches peak at 0.2 s).
3. Stimulated cAMP is too low!  Production of Gs leads to large AC5GsaGiaATP, and much smaller AC5GsaATP -> reduce affinity of Gia for Gs bound form (and vice versa?).  E.g. faster Gi dissociation from Gs bound form, (but also will need to slow Gs binding to Gi bound form, or speed Gs dissociation from Gi bound form.
Why does Da-Ca produce MUCH higher  cAMP than Da alone?  AC1 is now quite active.  This is OK.
4. Both GsaGTP and GiaGTP are higher and slightly increasing
previous values for good cAMP: AC5Gia   469.18 , AC5GsaGiaATP    92.76, AC5GsaATP    12.33
Current values                 AC5Gia: ~470      AC5GsaGiaTP    >500!!, AC5GsaATP  20
suggests too much Gi and Gs, though still not enough Gq!
a. Lower Gq hydrolysis
b. lower Gi and Gs production rates, or increase hydrolysis rates (or both).
5. During theta or 20 hz: AChm1RGq exceeds 200 during peaks, but GluMgluRGq only reachs 10, so of  course blocking it will not do anything. GluMgluRGq reaches 200 IN THE SPINE HEAD, but of course this structure is so small that the overall amount is too small.  Only 1-2 molecules of Gq bound Plc observed during theta
Need to increase both amounts in the spine:MgluR and Gq

##############Summary/new parameters:
1. Increase rate DaDbuf dissociation.  Rates: from 10 to 20
2. Increase MgluR to 800 in spine, and Gqabg to 8000 in spine.  
3. Gi bind to AC5Gs: kf=0.0125	kb=6 (3x higher)
   	  Gs bind to AC5Gi: kf=0.0037	kb=2.997 (3x higher)
4. Change Galphai production: kcat =4.0 (from 8.0) - less basal and stimulated Gi
5. Change Galphas hydrolysis: to 1.0 (from 0.5) - less basal and stimulated Gs

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Results
1. Basal:
GsaGTP: 3   AC5Gia: ~480   AC5GsaGiaATP   160-180; AC5GsaATP  40; GqaGTP: 10; PlcGqTot: 4
Gq slightly higher, though still low
AC5GsaGiaATP is much better, though still a bit high.  AC5GsaATP too high
cAMP=160 - way too high
D32p34PP1=~2500 - way too high, but better than previous; D32p75= 7500 - too low
phospho PDEs increase  to 40 (PDE4) and 80 (PDE10), minimal pDaD1RGs, pPP2A>200 - possibly explaining the Dp75

2. Bath:
cAMP increases to 3.9 uM for Da and 2.4uM for Da+Ca - this is high enough that PDEs can be increased

PDE1CamCa4 is 1500, but only 300 bound to cAMP -> perhaps affinity or rates should be higher to enhance activity dependence over basal?

3. Da Stim: though basal is too high, the pAKAR3 distinguishes the 4 different durations
1 s of Da gives ~600 nM, 0.3s gives 395n, 0.1s =306n.  What should they be?

4. Block: Dp34 increases with both OA and CyA.  The CyA increases is much slower. CyA bound to PP2B increases quite slowly, though CyA itself goes up rapidly.  This is not necessarily wrong - expers show that block develops over minutes, but makes it difficult to see effect within 5 min.

5. Stim: Gq bound Plc is ~5% of Ca bound. Blocking ACh eliminates all of that, blocking mGluR blocks none of it, even with much higher mGluR and Gq in spine.  Because still only 1-2 molecules of PlcCaGqaPip2 in the spine.  Perhaps Plc is limiting, because only 400 nM total Plc in spine head?  Perhaps GqGTPase is too fast (given the GTPase activity of Plc?)

##############New parameters
1. Go back to higher PDEs - this is 20% higher than previous.  
2. Speed CyA binding by 2x to see effect with 300s.  Decrease OA binding rate so that it is not so much faster than CyA, and so that D32p75 increases more slowly.
3. Reduce GqaGTPase to 0.1 in absence of Plc (perhaps even 0.01).
4. Fix MGluR rate constants: A: Were violating PMR, B: Mukhopaday and Ross say that GDP can dissociate at 1.5/sec and is rate limiting.
  --> Faster kcat for Gq production
  --> higher affinity for Glu to bind to Gq bound mGluR (instead of lower)
  --> Need to adjust Glu binding to MgluRGq when adjusting Glu binding to MgluR alone

Evaluate:
A. cAMP and downstream: If cAMP is now too low, reduce to only 10% higher
B. Gq, Plc bound Gq, effect of MGluR stimulation: if too low, increase Plc quantity in the spine?
C. effect of Block - increase Dp34 with CyA?
D. Effect of dopamine duration: need PKA acceleration of Gap activity against Gi to get larger effect of 0.1s Da?  Or lower tonic ACh for these simulations?

***************************Discovered bug in IC.  Not sure if any of the new parameter tuning is correct.
Re-do using old parameters



------->A) Research effects of alcohol.
	   investigate something about plasticity and alcohol
	B) What stimulation protocol would optimize LTP?
	   According to Reynolds - burst of Da needs to be AFTER ACh burst, e.g. by 0.6 sec.  Adjust theta stim file to achieve this.
>>>Added in DaDelay case

&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

For publication, do we simulate a D2R model?  Or alcohol effects?
