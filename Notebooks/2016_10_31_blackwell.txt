&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS (once model tuning finished):
    1. 20hz vs theta, create signature 
    2. Multi-spine sims - spatial specificity
    3. Other questions:
       a. role of ACh during burst or pause or rebound? - repeat sims without ACh burst 
       b. confirm role of CamKII phos Dgl? - repeat sims without pDgl 
       c. Can molecules substitute for others in signature? - sims with altered Ca or CaMKII, etc - evaluate signature
       d. alcohol effects
    6. parameter robusteness

10/31/2016: previous best response to bath application
Response to bath application (GiGsfast):
   	Dp34tot	  goal		Dp75	goal				Da	pAKAR3
basal	676-680	  500 nM	9750	10-12 uM			0.1	0.82
Da	4416	  5x  		6295	50%				0.3	0.89
Ca	260n	  50%		6666	25%				1	1.2
DaCa	1443	  2-3x		4935	unknown				10	2.6
CyA:	795	  3-17x		10.0	no change
OA:	1105n	  5x		34.2u	3x

A: Repeat sims using AC5 Gap activity against Gi (instead of Gap activity against Gs) with faster Gi production - is dip in GiaGTP detected with theta or 20hz, while still maintaining good basal?

>>>>>>>>>> Dip in GiaGTP produces peak in AC5GsaATP.  Dip : from 65 down to 10; peak from basal AC5GsaATP of 60 up to 115
	   peak of GiaGTP (to > 400 nM) produces slight dip in cAMP (from 300 down to 130ish) followed by peak in cAMP (750-900) during dip in GiaGTP.
	   Basal cAMP = 35, basal D32p34PP1=667.

B: Do parameters need to be tweaked given the altered reactions rates with the version 2 bug fix?
Repeat all sims plus Uchi sim to evaluate the mGluR/Gq effect.
Need update all Model files to use the GapGi reaction file
Updated m1block and m4block Rxn files to use the GapGi rates, so the Rxn file names were not updated in the model files

------->A) Research effects of alcohol.
	   investigate something about plasticity and alcohol
	B) What stimulation protocol would optimize LTP?
	   According to Reynolds - burst of Da needs to be AFTER ACh burst, e.g. by 0.6 sec.  Adjust theta stim file to achieve this.
>>>Added in DaDelay case

&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

For publication, do we simulate a D2R model?  Or alcohol effects?
