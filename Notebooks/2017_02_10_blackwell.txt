A. Started simulations using ACh =2 instead of =3 during burst for theta only
also started bathCa + block to compare to Nishi JBC 2017 paper
B. Developed initial sig.py.  Also modified neurdh5_anal.py
- use function for sstart and ssend in both

Initial debugged veresion of sig.py
sig.py subtracts baseline from each molecule, then sums (or subtracts) the molecules.  Currently no normalization, e.g. relative to maximum.  Could also try multiplying or dividing.
C. Removed rudimentary signature calculation from neurdh5_anal.py
