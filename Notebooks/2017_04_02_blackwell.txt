############ New parameters

1. Lower affinity of Pp2BCamCa2 for D32p34PP1 by 2x or 4x via lower kf - to raise basal D32p34 (good), and (hopefully) lower the PP2BCamCa2 bound form 

2. elminate ACh reduction during bath Da and DaCa - way too high cAMP

3. Reduce ALL Da stim to ~20-40% of current peak of 10 uM (improve AKAR response and DaBath)
Also, Da D1 agonist should not inhibit ACh, this is a D2 thing.  So, eliminate ACh pause from 10s stim

4. Replace CyA block mechanism with kcat=0
   In Model file - use nostim.xml (i.e., just ACh) instead of CyA stim file
      	    	 - use new Rxn file

Assess:
nostim, bath, noACh, DaDur:

SECOND:
Add in either Calpain or PKC phos of AC5 (or some other interaction whereby TRANSIENT or PRIOR calcium facilitates PKAc, though PROLONGED or LATER calcium inhibits Dp34)

THIRD: re-do Uchi
slightly higher initial Ca stim so that Uchi 100ms 0dhpg isn't negative
