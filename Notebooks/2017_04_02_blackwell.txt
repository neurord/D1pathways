############ New parameters

1. Lower affinity of Pp2BCamCa2 for D32p34PP1 by 2x or 4x via lower kf - to raise basal D32p34 (good), and (hopefully) lower the PP2BCamCa2 bound form 

2. elminate ACh reduction during bath Da and DaCa - way too high cAMP

3. Reduce ALL Da stim to ~20-40% of current peak of 10 uM (improve AKAR response and DaBath)
Also, Da D1 agonist should not inhibit ACh, this is a D2 thing.  So, eliminate ACh pause from 10s stim

4. Replace CyA block mechanism with kcat=0
   In Model file - use nostim.xml (i.e., just ACh) instead of CyA stim file
      	    	 - use new Rxn file


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>RESULTS
nostim, bath, noACh, DaDur:

nostim: much better, though cAMP, PKA and D32p34 drift up from ~600 to ~1000 beginning at 300 s.
Drift is caused by - unknown
----------->Solution: raise ACh a bit to inhibit AC5 more.  This will also help the ACh reduction be sensed.

noACh - very transient cAMP elevation.  Should ben enhanced by higher ACh

bath:
cAMP still reaches almost 20uM for bath Da
BATH:   Dp34    Dp34PP2B     Dp75
Basal	900	232	     10100	    
Ca	322	157	     7281
Da	3850	722	     7834
DaCa	2400	1131	     6044
GREAT - DaCa is lower than Da alone - 25% lower
Also, Ca reduces Dp75 more than Da
Also, DaCa has higher CKpCamCa4 than Ca alone

BLOCK:
With both OA and CyA, cAMP and PKAc decrease
with CyA, CKpCamCa4 increases (though calcium does not)
Dp34PP1 increases transiently (less than 2x), and then decreases, likely due to lower PKAc

WHy does cAMP decrease?  D32p34PP1 increases initially, which decreases PP1.  This allows higher PDE10 phosphorylation (because it is dephosphorylated by PP1), which lowers cAMP.  This suggests that I should change dephosphorylation of PDEs.

----------->Solution: PP2A dephos of PDEs.  Justified by
Resjo Biochem J 1999 states that PP2A dephos PDE3B
Mol Pharmacol. 2008 De Arcangelis V1, Soto D, Xiang Y. shows that PP2A inhibition enhances Phospholamban phosphorylation.  unknown whether effect is on PDE4 (though PDE4 implicated in cAMP control)

What would happen if PP2A instead of PP2B dephosphorylated PDE?

1. Since basal activity is higher, would need to lower rates
2. Because PP1 is reduced by PKA, replacing PP1 by PP2A will lower (but not eliminate) the strength of the negative feedback loop
3. What sort of feedback?
3a. PP2AB56d:As PKA increased, pPP2A increases - dephos PDE4 allowing more cAMP due to lower PDE activity - not good, because further decreases negative feedback loop strength.  If Dp75 increased that would decrease pPP2A and allow higher cAMP (and PKA - partially compensating for reduced PKA) - this might be OK.
3b. PP2ABPR72: If PP2Acal were active against pPDEs, then elevated calcium would LOWER PDE activity and ENHANCE cAMP.  This may be the synergy needed!  Might not need calpain. Would reduce the Dp34 reduction by Ca.
4.What would be predicted effect of OA and CyA?
       CyA: Dp34 increases. Low pp2a activity since no calcium, so cAMP and PKA remain similar. Dp34 contiues to increase
       OA: Dp34 increases. no pp2a means pPDE increases, which lowers cAMP and PKA, which lowers pPDE - may reach equilibrium.

###################### NEW PARAMETERS: 04/06/17
1. raise ACh by 20: ACh increased from 95 to 105, AChm4RGi raised by 10 and Gim4R decreased by 10 in dend
2. Replace PP1 dephos of PDE4/10 with PP2ABPR72 dephos of PDE4/10 - adjust rates to get same basal phos level

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>RESULTS
Very good nostim and bath response.  Both OA and CyA produce small increase in Dp34.  Unclear why increase is still limited.
Peak cAMP = 15 uM for Da bath.  Unknown if this is too high.  Possibly need faster phosphorylation of D1R
noACh: transient increase in cAMP and Dp34  Compensated by pPDE10 increase?

bath:
cAMP still reaches 15uM for bath Da - still high, but better
BATH:   cAMP   Dp34    Dp34PP2B Total  	Dp75
Basal	36     440     115	555    	10.7

GREAT - DaCa is lower than Da alone - 25% lower, even when adding in the PP2B forms
basal Da is great
Also, Ca reduces Dp75 slightly more than Da
Also, DaCa has higher CKpCamCa4 (276) than Ca alone (296)

block:   Dp34    Dp34PP2B Total  	Dp75
basal	 500	 114	  614		10.7u
CyA	 636	 200	  836		10.7u
OA	 626	 163	  762		35.5u
Only 36% increase with CyA, 25% increase with OA
pPDEs are still increasing with OA block, despite increase in Dp75!  This is causing slight decrease in cAMP and late decrease in Dp34 with OA.  This is caused by lack of PP2A which dephosphorylates pPDEs.  So, this mechanism, similar to PP1 dephos of pPDEs, is limiting increase in Dp34 with OA block.  Likely a 1st order pPDE dephos would allow greater Dp34 increase.
with OA: D32p75PKAc is increasing, PP2A bound forms of Dp75 and DP34 are decreasing as expected.  Large increase in Dp75 causes D32PKAc to decrease, accounting for only moderate increase in Dp34 with OA
SURPRISINGLY: OA_PP1 increases and then goes back down. WHY?  Still > 3 uM free PP1 with OA.  Perhaps affinity for PP1 is too low and there is too little OA?  Yes.  OA spikes and then decreases to 0 by 80 sec.  Repeat this with greater injection of OA.
with CyA: no compensatory increase in PP2A bound forms of Dp34
OA inhibition: article: Ki=150 nM for PP1, 32 pM for Pp2A; tocris: IC50=3 nM PP1, 0.1-1 nM PP2A
NISHI: OA blocks ~100% of PP2A but only 30% of PP1.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>RESULTS Stim:
evaluating pPDEs reveals that theta has higher phos than the most extremen DaDec for 20hz, but comparable to the others.
Overall pPDE4 is lowered, and possibly theta less so than others.  Signature of sum of all PKA targets reveals that theta is 50% greater than the most extreme DaDec of 20hz, but  comparable to the least extreme.  This suggests that the quite high Da used for theta is overkill.

ACh isoforms: very small effects
m4 block: higher cAMP, pDaD1RGs. but effect is small in dend. slightly higher Pkc for theta - trivial for 20hz
GiaGTP drops from 60 to 0, AChm4RGi drops from 50 to 0, AC5GsaATP increases ~35%
m1 block: lowers Pkc 25%, lowers 2ag 10%?
mGluR block: no effect in dendrite, large decrease of pKC in spine, BUT NOT OF 2AG.  Small effect on 2ag dendrite
------------------------------------------------------------

NEXT: 1. slightly higher initial Ca stim so that Uchi 100ms 0dhpg isn't negative
      Note that DaCaDgl indeed increases somewhat sharply, but 2ag is not.  It's increase is rather slow even with Dhpg.
2. try theta simulations with DaDec - bursts 2-10 are 2/3 of burst 1.  Based on 20hz results, this will not lower PKAc, and if this is new "control", it will make theta more similar to 20hz DaDec2 and DaDec3
If this works, repeat ACh flat, noB,noDIp, block M1,M4,MGLu and noCKp with this new Da, and choose either DaDec2 or DaDec3 to repeat all the 20hz sims.
3. inject more OA (2x) and repeat those sims.
4. Try PDE blocked sims - will need to re-init.  For now, simulate for 100s prior to injecting
papaverine affinity for PDE10: IC50 = 17 nM (PDE10A; https://www.scbt.com/scbt/product/papaverine-58-74-2)
rolipram affinity for PDE4: IC50=2.0 uM (Tocris)
exper shows almost saturating effect of pap at 1 uM (5x increase) but <2x for rolipram

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>RESULTS
1. DeDec didn't work - fix bug and rerun
2. OA: NO GOOD - free OA is now 50, but Dp75 increases to 50 u.  Go back to previous value
3. PDEblock:papaverine increase Dp34 to ~3 uM - OK, though Pap should be less quantity.  Rolipram didn't work.  re-run

-------->Another idea
PDE1 is another cAMP - calcium interaction molecule
It is enhanced by calcium.  So that the large calcium with theta will reduce cAMP
Due to high affinity for CamCa4, there is very little difference btween theta and 20hz.
Binding to CamCa4 is currently very fast in the model.  If it were slowed down, it might decrease the effect during transient stimulation (e.g. theta and 20hz) without changing response to prolonged, bath stimulation.

######################### PDE1 binding to CamCa4 has kf=0.001, kb=0.01 (100x slower)
repeat:
bath sims
theta and 20hz with DaDec
Dastim - too much Da in spine for spatially nonspecific uncaging

(possibly if there is difference between 20hz PKA and theta PKA, could have PKA enhance Gi hydrolysis (positive fb loop))
Then,
1. repeat ACh flat, noB,noDip, block M1,M4,MGLu and noCKp with new Da theta, while:
*2. try DaDelay sims again - or create new Reynolds sims 
UPDATED 3. Update 20hz stim files before doing multi-spine sims again, and add Da stimulation of non-stim spine, while:
*4. alcohol sims

SIGNATURE:  treat PKA targets differently than Pkc and CKpCam?

if necessasry:
Add in either Calpain or PKC phos of AC5 (or some other interaction whereby TRANSIENT or PRIOR calcium facilitates PKAc, though PROLONGED or LATER calcium inhibits Dp34)
