&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS:
DONE:     1. Fix/verify dendritic injection - using bath and bathDend

DONE:     2. Repeat fastPKA simulation, then evaluate the fast PKA and decide whether (how) to keep (or not)
     	       reduce PKA phos of DaD1R and PDE4/10?  NO.  KEEP FAST PKA
     3. Fix non-ACh basal cAMP value (vs nostim): STEP 1 = GsaGTPase = 0.5e-3, compare ACh basal vs no AChls  
     IF TOO LOW cAMP with nostim case, add in AC1 HERE.  DONE
NO:    	a. add in Ca inhib of AC5? - NO, this will be too low at basal Ca
DONE:	b. enhance GsaGTP degradation rate?  Decrease Gsabg quantity?  Enhance PKA phos of PDE4/10? or PDE quantity?  A little of each?
	GsaGTPase = 0.125e-3, vs 1.0e-3 for Gi and Gq
	Gsabg=1840nM / 1945 pSD vs Gi=1760nM / 1700pSD vs Gq=2000nM / 1000pSD.  Is Gs less abundant than Gi?
DONE:	c. run several nostim cases, use end of sim for IC for all but block cases, and use new IC values for block cases
	
   June 6:
DONE:     4. add in AC1 - 10% of AC5 values, use faster PKA, increase PDEs while tuning nostim cases

Jun 10-15:
     5. once close, then do
DONE     5a.     Da (lower ACh?), NEED TO LOWER ACH
--->   	bath and block cases for final tuning
     	use ic start and earlier application for bath cases
     6. Then, do 20hz vs theta

########## Testing out new features of neurord using NeuroRD-3.1.2
A. Evaluate injection directly into dendrite, comare to bath alone

>>>>>>>>most molecules look the same.  cAMP and down stream molecules look different.
This is due to difference in GiaGTP, which is lower for Da alone with fake spines (10 vs 60 nM).
Lower GiaGTP caused by lower AChm4RGi (10 nM vs 60 nM), despite same ACh, same Rxn file, same IC file.
The Ca bath h5 file did not write properly.

B.########## What happens if decrease ACh alone??
Model_SPNspineCaMKII_DagL_AChm4R-noACh.xml - this eliminates the basal ACh stim.
Model_SPNspineCaMKII_DagL_AChm4R-nostim.xml
>>>>>>>cAMP increases to 5 uM with no ACh, decreases to 6 nM with 50nM ACh

##GsaGTPase = 0.5e-3
>>>>>>>cAMP increases to 2.5 uM with no ACh, decreases to 20 nM with 50nM ACh
This seems better, but in both cases D32p34PP1 saturates
Dag increases to 200 nM, Ip3~150 nM with ACh, decrease to near zero without ACh
ACh has been made too strong.  Need to weaken it again.  Reducing Gi quantity will not change Gq pathways
1. Halve the ACh binding - both high and low affinity sites (could also make 1/4 the rate based on Leach)
   This will reduce basal inhibition, which will increase basal cAMP but reduce basal Dag, etc.
2. Increase AC1 - better to add in now, then have to re-adjust everything later.
3. Increase PKA rate - better to add in now, then have to re-adjust everything later.
4. Mechanism to reduce cAMP, since ACh has been reduced but AC1 added
   what mechanisms were used earlier on to increase ACh once m4 was added?  Adjustment of PDE conc!
C. ########## Should PKA activation be faster still?  Might need to compensate some reactions (NO!):
   a. dephos of DaD1RGS - currently 1st order - easy to speed up, but also could use phosphatase
   b. dephos of PDEs - currently 1st order - easy to speed up, but also could use phosphatase
   c. DARPP: currently value is a bit low, so doubling PKA would not need to be compensated completely.  PP2B dephos kcat is currently 0.5.  Measured value: King, Hemmings: Vmax =0.2-1/sec.  So, could speed this up.
   d. AKAR3
Note that increased activation rate of PKA will mostly not affect the basal, steady state level.  It  could have small effect if PKAc dissociated more often from PKAr at basal level.  But if no change in basal, then no need to compensate the dephos rates, EXCEPT the AKAR3 since it is too high.
-------> repeat the nostim case with 5x rate of PKA activation (Jeanette uses 20x the current rate!)

Gshydr=0.5, AC1rxn, fast PKA
>>>>>>>>with 0 nM ACh, cAMP increase to 1.6 uM
	With 50 nM ACh, cAMP is 0 nM
cAMP with no ACh is much better than previous simulation, however, cAMP with ACh is much lower than previous simulation. WHY?
1. 10% increase in AC (AC1) should increase cAMP, but opposed by 20% increase in PDEs
2. no difference in Gs hydrolysis
3. lower ACh affinity for m4 means less inhibition at basal levels of ACh -> should have less AC5GiGs at basal ACh
Yes, it does.  Interestingly, the AC5GsaGiaATP still declines to zero (even faster than with ACh stimulation).
PROBLEM: no Da observed in the new model! Basal Da decreases to 0 with no stim.
With Da present, this should be fine - re-run sim to see if problem is repeatable.
Need still lower cAMP with ACh absent - still higher PDEs?  Also run the Da duration sims.
Add another 20% = 280 (700 head and neck), PDE4=280, PDE2=280
Rerun no stim and no ACH, also add in Da stim case to get some idea of how far away.

>>>>>>>>>
1. Another bug was found: sometimes CaOut is not being initialized as specified.  All cases where Ca drops to 0 has this problem, thus all Ca dependent molecules will be wrong.
nostim: Da~10, ACh~50, Ca decreases to 0; cAMPbasal~40, PKAc basal=4; Dp34 increases to ~1.5 uM due to no PP2BCamCa4!
	cAMP basal is fine.  Unknown whether the Dp34PP1 will be good due to Ca issue
noACh: Da~10, ACh~0, Ca~80; cAMPbasal inc to 1.2 uM (better, but still too high), PKAc basal inc to 40, D32p34PP1 saturates
cAMP is transient - declines to 700 nM - decrease probably due to phosphorylation of PDE4, PDE10 and DaD1RGS (though the latter is quite low).  Are these mechanisms too slow?
DaDur simulations: all but 0.1 worked
      		   Basal	   Stim
cAMP: 		   40 nM	   0.5u, 0.8u, 2.5u for 0.3, 1.0, 10s of Da (and normal ACh)
PKA   		   4  		   15n, 30n, 50n    for 0.3, 1.0, 10s and normal ACh; decay time ~20s, much longer for 10s Da 
D32p34		  800 nM 	   3.5u,4.2,5.0u  - decay much longer - better representation of AKAR
D32p75		  10.8 uM	   decay larger with more Da stim.
pPDE4		  5    		   18 (vs 120 non phos and bound to cAMP)
pPDE10		  1		   40 (vs 500 non phos and bound to cAMP)
Based on the first 50 sec of these simulations, basal cAMP and Dp34 are pretty good.  Likely would get a greater cAMP signal with lower ACh - try that
2. How to improve (reduce) cAMP response with no ACh?
    phosphorylation of PDEs is only ~10%.  Need faster phos for them to have much effect.
    This would slightly decrease D32p34PP1 - which is fine since now high end of range
    Allow PKAc to phosphorylate PDE4cAMP
    What about dephos?  Currently it is 1st order.  What if PP1 dephosphorylated PDEs?
    Dephos would slow down with high D32p34PP1 - good
     
##########
double rates of PKAc phos of PDE4
replace dephos with PP1.  Current rate = 0.005e-3.  PP1quant=4 uM = 4000 nM
Current (maximal) rate = 20 nM pPDE4 * 0.005e-3
New rate (hill approx): pPDE4*PP1free*kcat/(pPDE4+km)
if pPDE4 << km, then new rate = pPDE4*PP1free*kcat/km
compare 0.005e-3 with PP1free*kcat/km 
arbitrarily select km=500 nM (10x higher than maximum expected with increased phos rates)
0.005e-3/msec=3400 nM * kcat / 500 nM; kcat=0.005e-3*(500/3400)= 7.35e-7 = .00073e-3
if kcat=0.25*kb, then
>>>kcat=0.0008e-3, kb=0.0032e-3; and kf=0.008e-6 yields Km of 500 nM
also, PP1free*kcat/(kcat+kb)/kf = PP1free*kcat*kf/(kcat+kb)
if kcat=0.25*kb, then eqn reduces to PP1free*kcat*kf/(5*kcat) = PP1free*kf/5
0.005e-3=3400*kf/5; kf=0.005e-3*5/3400 = 7.35e-9  Very close to 0.008e-6
At low pPDE4 and pPDE10 conc, dephos rate is similar.  As PP1 binds to Dp34, dephos rate will decrease.
for high pPDE4 and pPDE10 conc increase, rate will increase sub-linearly
************Add these rates (PP1 dephos and 2x PKAc phos of PDE) to spreadsheet
PP1 dephos of PDE4/10: kcat=0.0008e-3, kb=0.0032e-3,  kf=0.008e-6

########## New simulations as of June 14, 2016
USE
a. faster PKA,
b. greater Gs hydrolysis PLUS lower affinity of ACh for m4 - these should balance somewhat wrt cAMP
c. double rate of PKA phos of PDE4/10, PP1 dephos of PDE4/10 (to reduce their dephos when PKA and p34DARPPP32 are high) - these should enhance control of cAMP during bath application
d. dendritic injection (instead of fake spines) - this should improve computational efficiency somewhat
e. AC1: help support cAMP basal in response to the greater Gs hydrolysis.

SIMULATE:
1. Da stim 0.1-10sec using lower rate of ACh (0.3 instead of 0.5), and AKAR
2. Repeat nostim and noACh using faster PDE phos, PP1 dephos

>>>>>>>>>>>>>> cAMP increase to ~200 nM when ACh is lowered
------------>  this is fine for now.  Possibly below range of sensor used to detect the larger cAMP signals in striatal neurons.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Da 0.1s is too long and similar to Da 0.3s.  Need to work on this stimulation
		 cAMP and PKAc do not increase as much as expected.
------------>Should probably reduce the ACh during stimulation for these simulations.  E.g. stop replacement for 0.2s for 0.1s, 0.6s for 0.3s, 2s for 1s, and 20s for 10s.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>  All other results are suspect because there are random changes in CaOut and DaOut which are altering basal Ca and Da.
------------>  THUS, do not perform these altered Da simulations until code is fixed?
	       
&&&&&&& To finish model:
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

Still need to evaluate the following:
1. Chuhma et al., 2014: 10 ms time constant for action of activated G proteins -> may need faster G protein production (and degradation).  Currently G protein production is considerably slower than DaD1RGs binding?
