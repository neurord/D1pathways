Create STDP protocols using single pulse calcium injection used for trains - both fino and P&K. DONE
Test the protocols (simulate using Rxn_stimtest.xml) to test calcium amplitude, and then adjust either upward or downward to achieve the calcium levels shown in Asia's models.

>>>>>RESULT:
Fino Calcium = 1 uM - perfect for backward.  Increase 5x for Forward (spine only)
Dopamine: 500 nM - decrement subsequent pulses.
Glutamate - non in dend, < 200 nM spine - increase 4x.

>>>>>>> New results:Ca stim spine: dur = 60, rate=156 (for), dur=12, rate=156 (back)

NOTE that molecules and calcium especially may be lower with other binding proteins, since single pulse is same as used for TBS and 20 Hz.

>>>>>>>>Results simulate full model (dur=15 forward, dur=3 backward, rate=156):
Calcium spine is too low
1. 500 nM Fino forward, 250 nM Fino Backward: increase by 4x both forward and back, spine only.
2. 1st pulse in dendrite is 200 nM forward, 111 nM backward.  OK
3. PK forward is 300-400 nM, PK back is 150-200 nM: also increase by 4x forward and back, spine only.
4. Da: > 2 uM spine, ~300 nM dend: OK
5. Glu: ~500 nM PK spine, ~800 nM PK spine.

1. No difference in Epac1 or Dp34 between forward and backward - this is expected from same dopamine signals and same ACh signals
2. Pkc and CKpCam are higher for forward than backward - expected from difference in calcium signals.  
Calcium still too low in spine compared to Asia simulations - increase calcium for both forward and backward and repeat simulations
3. Essentially no 2ag produced with PK backward - likely due to extremely low calcium

PK For	    500n	   3u/300n 	600/40  

PK: calcium not high enough - only 3-4 u for Forward and 500n back - repeat simulations with
dur=90 forward, dur=18 backward

Possibly missing the very high (but transient?) spine peak.  Otherwise, insufficient gradient from spine to dend

NEXT:
A: repeat sig.py for 5 molecule sums 
B: run sig2-60s to generate file for SAS
C: re-do discrminant analysis with STDP outcome known
