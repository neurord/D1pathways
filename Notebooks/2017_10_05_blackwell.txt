Create STDP protocols using single pulse calcium injection used for trains - both fino and P&K. DONE
Test the protocols (simulate using Rxn_stimtest.xml) to test calcium amplitude, and then adjust either upward or downward to achieve the calcium levels shown in Asia's models.

>>>>>RESULT:
Fino Calcium = 1 uM - perfect for backward.  Increase 5x for Forward (spine only)
Dopamine: 500 nM - decrement subsequent pulses.
Glutamate - non in dend, < 200 nM spine - increase 4x.

NEXT: simulate full model
