Create STDP protocols using single pulse calcium injection used for trains - both fino and P&K. DONE
Test the protocols (simulate using Rxn_stimtest.xml) to test calcium amplitude, and then adjust either upward or downward to achieve the calcium levels shown in Asia's models.

>>>>>RESULT:
Fino Calcium = 1 uM - perfect for backward.  Increase 5x for Forward (spine only)
Dopamine: 500 nM - decrement subsequent pulses.
Glutamate - non in dend, < 200 nM spine - increase 4x.

>>>>>>> New results:
	rate		dendPK	spinePK	   dendFino	spineFino
ACh	3		165n	1u	   165n		1u	
Da	18/9		300n	5u	   300n		5u
Glu	5		40n	500n	   40n		500n
Cal	3 (15 spine For)1u/2u	8u/22u	   1u/2u	8u/22u
NOTE that molecules and calcium especially may be lower with other binding proteins, since single pulse is same as used for TBS and 20 Hz.

NEXT: simulate full model

To re-do discrminant analysis:
1. Add in STDP protocols to known
2. Include the 40% theta control protocol in known
