######################### PDE1 binding to CamCa4 has kf=0.001, kb=0.01 (100x slower)
repeat:
bath sims
theta and 20hz with DaDec
Dastim - too much Da in spine for spatially nonspecific uncaging.  Reduce spine stim dramatically

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Bath
Da peak is now 10 uM, and ~16 uM in spine (could reduce spine Da further)
cAMP peak is 20 uM
Dp34=4.6 uM (Da), 3.5 (DaCa)
PDE1CamCa4 elevation is noticeably delayed, which is causing the excess cAMP elevation compared to the faster rates

>>>>>>>>>>>Da duration
Peak value for 10s bath is now similar to peak for 1s wrt Dp34
pAKAR3 is still larger for the 10s bath than 1 s uncaging.
Longer uncaging pulse yields larger pAKAR3 and faster rise.  1s uncaging has faster  decay than 0.1 or 0.3 sec, likely due to slightly greater pPDE10

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Theta vs 20hz
1. Effect of DaDec (and slower PDE1) on theta response:
cAMP is lower, PKAc is slightly lower.  Dp34 is ~10% lower, pPP2A, pPDE10 is ~25% lower
pPDE1 has quite different trajectory: lower peak (1.1 vs 1.5 uM) doesn't return to basal between pulses.  THIS might be cause of lower cAMP.  Average PDE1 bound to cAMP is similar, with larger deviations for the slower PDE1/
CKpCam is significantly greater!  possibly due to less CamCa4 bound to PDE1
2. theta vs 20hz.
Theta with DaDec has Da 2x that of 20hz daDec2, and 4x that of 20hz DaDec3.
phospho proteins are now similar to the DaDec2, and DaDec3 is only slightly smaller.  This may be partly due to more effective PDE1CamCa4.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Block:
papaverine causes large increase in Dp34 (5x), Rolipgram causes only small increase in Dp34 - CONSISTENT WITH EXPERS.

######################### Use PDE1 binding to CamCa4 has kf=0.01, kb=0.1 (only 10x slower)
1. repeat ALL sims: Bath, DaDur, Block
2. Repeat ALL theta vs 20hz, including: ACh flat, noB,noDip, block M1,M4,MGLu and noCKp with new Da theta
3. try DaDelay sims again, using new lower Da

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Bath
cAMP peak is now lower 17 uM for Da alone
Dp34=4.6 uM (Da), 3.9 (DaCa) at the peak, and peak is quite transient for DaCa - 2 min after bath appl Dp34 dec to 4uM for Da and 2.2 uM for DaCa
PDE1CamCa4 elevation not delayed - slightly slower increase compared to the really slow rates
Strange rebound transient present in Da and DaCa sims.  Begins at 245 sec with sharp increase in AC5GsaATP in the presence of slow decrease in GsaGTP.  Accompanied by compensatory decrease in AC5GsaGia, though no sharp decrease in GiaGTP.  Only slow decrease beginning at 247 sec.  Possibly the tolerance is too big?  An error was seen in a simpler system, which was eliminated with smaller tolerance, though that was related to stimulation.  Re-run with tolerance =0.001 to see if that is cause, anyway.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Block:
1 uM Papeverine: cAMP increases to ~200 nM, which elevates PKAc and Dp34 (to 2 uM = 4x increase) GOOD
1 uM Rolipram: no increase in cAMP, no change in Dp34
OA: Dp75 increases to 3.7 uM, Dp34 transiently increases to 800 nM before declining due to excessive Dp75 and increased phospho PDE10 (due to inhibited PP2A)
CyA: ~20% increase in Dp34  from 690 to 840
-------------->PP2A dephos of PDE10 does not help OA block condition.  Perhaps going back to 1st order would be better
>>>>>>>>>>>> noACh: transient cAMP increase, then returns to basal
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Theta vs 20hz - controls
PKC and CKpCamCa4 differ the most between 20hz and theta.  Dp34 , pPP2A, pPDE10 also differs.  Alternatively, looking at PKA bound proteins also shows a differece. Use sig.py to sum PKA phosphoproteins and PKAc bound forms.  May need to add additional normalization factor representing maximum achievable.  But maybe not, since sum of PKA isoforms (300-500) is actually 2x that of Pkc or CkpCam
    	AUC:	  	    theta  	20hz, DaDec3
sum of PKA phosphoproteins: 579		463		25% greater
sum of PKAc bound proteins: 93		78		20% greater
Peak values differ by ~33% (pProteins) or 40% (PKAbound)
PKAc bound + Pkc+CKp  	   142	       95		50% great.  Threshold at 500 (dend) and 700 (spine)
PKAc+Pkc+Ckp+epac	   162	       111		46% greater.  Threshold at 600 (dend)
2ag is similar for both protocols.  Lowers all AUC.
>>>>>>>>>>> Block cases:
block MGlu had lower signature, both spine and dendrite for theta, lower signature for spine, not dend for 20hz.
block m4 had ~10% higher signature dend for 20hz and theta, slightly higher sig for spine for 20hz
block m1: lower signature 20hz spine, lower signature theta dend
block Ckp: higher sig 20hz and lower sig theta - they now look similar
ACh variantes: 20hz noDip had much lower signature than all the others
20hz noB and flat had signature similar to theta
Conclusion: shape of ACh is not important for theta.  20hz noBurst (no Burst of Gi) allows elevated cAMP for 20hz?  Check molecules.  Flat has no burst of Gi and also allows elevated cAMP?  Perhaps the burst of Gi has less effect when Da is quite high, as with theta.  Only important to facilitate low Da signals?  If so, then m4 block should elevate 20hz response similarly (or even more).  That is evident in the spine, but not the dendrite

>>>>>>>>>>>>> smaller tolerance:
GOOD: the strange rebound cAMP is gone
BAD: peak cAMP is now 50 uM, not 15 uM, but basal cAMP is similar.  Which other simulations & molecules will be difference with smaller tolerance???  How to fix stimulated cAMP without affecting basal cAMP?  Increase PDE2 - 4x?
Can tolerance be bigger than 0.001?  e.g. 0.002, to avoid 4x longer simulations?

############ New simulations started on 4/24:
1. Need to re-run blockM4 and AChnoDip - didn't finish
READY 2. Re-try 1st order dephos of pPDE4 and pPDE10.  Use previous rate of 0.005e-03
READY 3. Test whether Calpain would improve things.  conc=100 nM, kf=kb=0.0001/sec bind cdk5, 
READY 4. alcohol sims -
   A. 2x increase in NMDA calcium: 2x increase in spine calcium, not dendrite
   B. Change in some molecule quantities: 25% reduction in AC, 25% increase in Gbg, 2x mGluR.  may need to reduce PDE to maintain basal
   C. both changes together

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Calpain results - compare to non-calpain
bathCa: Dp75 decreases to 7496 (calpain) vs 7457 (ctrl) - no effect
CaCalpCdk5 increases to 10 - very little, and Cdk5D32 is similar.  Try once more with faster Kf for calpain effect

>>>>>>>>>>>>> pPDE1st results: lower cAMP.
cAMP signaling is better for Calpain than pPDE1st.
        theta   20hz
Calpain: 119 vs 89	35%
pPDE1st: 103 vs 90	14%
ctrl:	 98  vs 78	26%

Re-evaluate Calpain (but not pPDE1st) after tolerance/new NeuroRD is assessed

******************************PLAN:
1. Evaluate new neuroRD 3.2.3.  What value of tolerance is needed??? DO IC need to be adjusted, e.g. more PDE2?
2a. Repeat bath and ctrl theta/20hz simulations with new neuroRD, correct tolerance and IC
2b. Evaluate whether Calpain is better, and use the best mechanism
3. Repeat all sims, including multi-spine
4. once alcohol IC changes seem "reasonable", repeat sims with new nostim-initialization -  may need to reduce PDE to maintain basal
2. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> RESULTS of new NeuroRD evaluation
1. Still see an increase in cAMP when stimulation turns off (tol=0.01 and 0.005) but it occurs around the time of turn off, instead of much later.  Change in AC5Gs is much smaller (100 vs 300).  FOr tol=0.005, occurs in only 1 trial, and amplitude is ~5000, whereas amp is 5000 - 10000 for tol=0.01.  Also, peak cAMP is 36-40 uM, thus rebound is < 30% of peak, whereas rebound is > 50% of peak in old NeuroRD
2. tol=0.01 now takes 19 hours (vs 12 hours 3.2.2), tol=0.005 takes 1 day.  So, sims will definitely take longer
3. Smaller tolerances: still running

------------------------> Definitely need to increase PDE2 to prevent huge cAMP peak.  Basal is still fine.
Try 4x (or more?) increase in PDE2

SIGNATURE:  treat PKA targets differently than Pkc and CKpCam?
	    Issues: Normalization or weight?  Normalize to maximum over all paradigms?  Weight epac differently than Pkc?
	    Divide instead of subtract 2ag?  Have 4 thresholds: LTD vs LTP and spine vs dendrite?
	    To implement the latter, make 4 different graphs, add in threshold line?

if necessary:
Consider Pkc phos of AC5 (will this interaction allow PRIOR calcium to facilitate PKAc, though PROLONGED or LATER calcium inhibits Dp34)
Pkc is same for Da or DaCa and quite high - cAMP and PKA would be enhanced for both
Pkc is so much higher for theta, that this would enhance cAMP for theta, would not inhibit AC5 if occured afterwards.

Review paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003456/
Ca inhibition of AC5 (perhaps slow inhibition would be good for bath sims?)
"The evidence is conflicting for the regulation of both ACs by PKC, despite data showing binding and/or phosphorylation of the enzymes (Kawabe et al. 1994; Iwami et al. 1995; Lai et al. 1997; Lin et al. 2002; Rhim et al. 2006)."

possibly if there is difference between 20hz PKA and theta PKA, could have PKA enhance Gi hydrolysis (positive fb loop)?
