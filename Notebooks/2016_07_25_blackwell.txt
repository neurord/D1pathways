&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS:
DONE    1. Validate the nostim and ACh depletion cases. Da durations (Castro) with lower ACh during Da stim
DONE    2. bath and block cases for final tuning
NOW     	use ic start and earlier application for bath cases to save computational time
--------->	Possibly repeat all prior cases using better ic (end July)
NOW    3. Then, repeat 20hz vs theta, create signature (end July, begin Aug)
    4. Multi-spine sims - spatial specificity (after signature and good IC) (Aug, while away)
    5. Other questions:
       a. role of ACh during burst or pause or rebound? - repeat sims without ACh modulation
       b. confirm role of CamKII phos Dgl? - repeat sims without pDgl
       c. Can molecules substitute for others in signature? - repeat sims as above
    5. parameter robusteness

##################
---------> 1. Repeat the Da Stim simulations with (a) no reduction in ACh, and (b) slower AKAR phos (see 07_18 Notebook)
---------> 2. Run the CyA and OA block cases (faster Gshydr and AC1 have not been run with these)
---------> 3.  Re-run nostim for 1000 s to determine if ss is still lower.
---------> 4. Try noACh with new injection method and 500s - new inject shouldn't make a difference, but need to check, see whether basal cAMP comes down further.  Also, use trials =3 to see if it works this time (doesn't get stuck).
>>>>>>>Bath stim results: Very similar to previous results (and to experiments):
                 basal/stim Dp34  goal     basal/stim Dp75 goal         assessment
        Da       407/5.2u          5x      10.8u/6.3u   50%             BOTH goals met, though Dp75 reduction could be more
        Ca       429n/1.3u         50%     11.0u/6.6u   75%             Dp75 decreases a bit too much
        DaCa     508n/4.0u      50% of Da  11.1u/4.7u                   Close to goal met
        CyA:     ??/2.5u      	3-17x      11.1u/9.7u  100%             3x over "max basal" of 400
        OA:      ??/0.8u       	1.3x,5x         44.8u        3x         2x over "max basal" of 400
        CyA+Ca   ??/2.9u                   11.0u/6.8u           	higher Dp34 than Ca without CyA     
        CyA+Da   ??/5.3u                   11.0u/5.8u			Dp34 similar to Da alone
---------->Very nice Dp34 increase with CyA block.  Similar Dp75 increase as previous with OA block
Could adjust the Da vs Ca effect on Dp75 by increase the PKA phos subunit vs Ca dep subunit of PP2A
Ca should cause reduction in Dp34.  Perhaps the increase reflects the non-basal level of Dp34PP1?

Da Stim:
cAMP for 10s is 6 uM, which is fine.
0.1s Da produces lower pAKAR3 than 0.3 or 1s, which is slightly lower than 10s.  This is an improvement, but the decrease from peak is till too fast.
Perhaps slow down phos and dephos of AKAR3 another 2x?

noStim: D32p34PP1 decreases to 1 uM at 500s.
############## slow down phos and dephos of AKAR3 another 2x, repeat Da Stim.  
Also try 20Hz vs Theta - 1 spine, using the new coupled stimulation
Run noACh without trials=3 switch, and try the re-start with nostim - does it work?  what is Dp34 steady state?

>>>>>Da stim: pAKAR3 is better.  now the 0.3 does not saturate.  Rise time ~30 sec (20s for 10s Da).
Decay time is ~30 sec, still a bit fast.  It almost follows the decay in D32p34pp1 - suggesting that PP1 is too fast and it's availability is limitin dephos.
--------> slow down PP1 dephos another 2x, also change phos and dephos rates to use the 4x rule of kb:kcat, which will lower affinity of PKA for AKAR from 50 nM to 150 nM - still quite high
>>>>>restart:
	works great!  additional 500 s reveals that D32p34PP1 equilibrium is indeed near or above 1 uM
-----> need to lower balance of kinases and phosphatases active at D32p34PP1 (without lowering D32p75 phosphorylation)
       a. increase PP2B dephos still further - CANNOT, PP2B is at its max
       b. increase PP2A activity a bit (will slightly increase D32p75 basal, which is closer to 10 uM)
       	  DONE.  Go back to values in spreadsheet, since OA has insufficient effect.
----> use restart for the Ca/Da bath sims, with short wait prior to stim

A. change the block cases to inject blockers (add in block reactions) in order to allow re-start facility
   block reactions do not need to be extremely fast
B. run noACh and nostim with new AKAR rates and also D32p34 stuff

C. do Da and Bath with new rates and re-start, do block with new rates, re-start and block inject
  ****** need to create new stim files!!!  
D. do theta and 20hz with new rates and re-start
############## AKAR rates (per sec):
PKA phos: 0.00625, 0.75,0.1875
PP1 dephos: 0.000125, 0.6, 0.156
PP2A rates: 0.0003, 12.2, 2.8 against PP1 bound D32p34
CyA IC50: Tocris: 5 nM; Oetjen .. Knepel 2005 - 10 nM; Groblewski, Wagner, Williams - 65 nM
OA inhibition: article: Ki=150 nM for PP1, 32 pM for Pp2A; tocris: IC50=3 nM PP1, 0.1-1 nM PP2A
Quantity to inject (PP1tot=4 uM, PP2Atot=2.8 uM, PP2Btot= 5uM):
NISHI: cyclosporin: 5 uM, OA: 1 uM - but needs to be this concentration FREE, since bath perfused
NISHI: OA blocks ~100% of PP2A but only 30% of PP1.
Therefore, inject ~10 CyA and 6 OA?  Check how much is free and bound after block simulations
Add these changes to latest files.  Need 4 new stim files:
Stim_AChCyA.xml 
Stim_AChOA.xml 
Stim_CaBathCyA.xml
Stim_DaBathCyA.xml

Test out Eliminating ATP.  If no depletion incorporate ATP binding into kf of kf*ATP*ACx
   This will eliminate 1 diffusing species of high conc, and 5 reactions
   Multiply forwardRate by 2e6, eliminate <Reactant specieID="ATP"/> for the following reactions:
   1.  <Reaction name = "AC5Gsa+ATP--AC5GsaATP reac" id="AC5Gsa+ATP--AC5GsaATP_id">
     <forwardRate> 0.1276e-6 -> 0.255
   2.  <Reaction name = "AC5GsaGia+ATP--AC5GsaGiaATP" id="AC5GsaGia+ATP--AC5GsaGiaATP">
     <forwardRate> 0.01276e-6 -> 0.0255
   3. <Reaction name = "AC1GsaGTPCamCa4_ATP_Reac" id="AC1GsaGTPCamCa4_ATP_Reac">
    <forwardRate>0.01e-3</forwardRate> ->  -> 20.0
   4.  <Reaction name = "AC1CamCa4ATP_bind" id="AC1CamCa4ATP_bind">
     <forwardRate>0.01e-3</forwardRate> -> 20.0
    5. Eliminate AMP -> ATP reaction
    6. make ATP = 0 as initial conditions
Compare to results with explicit ATP

>>>>>>>>>> NO ATP: Simulation time was no faster, so go back to previous
New basal of D32p34PP1 ~ 600-800 nM - much better than previous.

2016 July 29:
######## using higher PP2A dephos of D32p34PP1 and slower dephos of AKAR3
1. Repeat Da stim sims: use re-start, start inject after 20s, decrease simtime by 50s, inject AKAR at 0s
2. Repeat Bath sims: use re-start, start inject after 20s, decrease simtime by 50
Not ready yet:
3. Repeat Bath BLock sims: use re-start, start inject after 20s, decrease simtime by 50, inject CyA and OA at 1s
4. theta and 20 Hz

2016 Aug 1:
>>>>>>>> nostim using restart: basal remains the same (GREAT)
       dephos of AKAR3 is slower, but never reaches basal.  Why?
       cAMP, PKAc, PP1 do not return to basal by 200s.  Appears to be two phases of decay.
       phosph PDEs should make new cAMP basal lower
       elevation in pPP2A diverts some PP2A from D32p34, and pPP2A does not return to basal.

>>>>>>>>>> Da stim sims
AKAR3: 3.7 uM - inject 20% less
D32p34PP1: 460 nM (slight dec, due to AKAR3?)
cAMP: 400, 472, 613, 6000: too small a difference with brief stim, especially 0.3 and 1s needs larger peak/duration
pAKAR3: similar too small difference among the briefer Da stimuli.

>>>>>>>>>> Bath stims
D32p34PP1 basal between 682-750, flat
>>>>>>>Bath stim results: Very similar to experiments, though D32p34 changes too quickly (< 30 sec):
                 basal/stim Dp34  goal     basal/stim Dp75 goal         assessment
        Da       700/4.8u          5x      9.8u/6.5u   50%             BOTH goals met, though Dp75 reduction too small
        Ca       749n/427         50%      9.7u/6.4u   75%             BOTH goals met, though Dp75 reduction too big
        DaCa     683n/3.4u      50% of Da  9.9u/5.0u                   BOTH goals met, though Dp34 dec is too brief

	CyA:     ??/u      	3-17x      u/u  100%             
        OA:      ??/u       	1.3x,5x         u        3x      
        CyA+Ca   ??/u                   0u/u           	
        CyA+Da   ??/u                   0u/u		

Transient response to Da probably due to PDE10/4 neg feedback loop on cAMP.
	  pPDE10 inc to ~150 total, and pPDE4 to ~80.
pDgl increases to 80, CapDgl to 170.  Might be sufficient to decrease 2ag with theta.

########### Block/bath sims using CyA and OA inject and re-start
	    Theta/20Hz with restart and higher PP activity\
	    Repeat Da duration with less AKAR inject
	    
&&&&&&& CONSIDER:
1. 5x faster CamKII phos of DagL (going back to higher pDagL activity) if still insufficient 2ag suppression
2. To speed Da pulses: increase extrusion rate, e.g. 10x; increase injected amount to compensate, e.g. 10x
   test this AFTER testing new method for compensation

	       
&&&&&&& To finish model:
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

Still need to evaluate the following:
1. Chuhma et al., 2014: 10 ms time constant for action of activated G proteins -> may need faster G protein production (and degradation).  Currently G protein production is considerably slower than DaD1RGs binding?
