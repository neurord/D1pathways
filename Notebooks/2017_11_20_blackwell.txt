A. Additional simulations
1. no ACh simulation:  Transient increase in cAMP, Dp34, Epac1cAMP.  Then, increase in pPDE10 - negative feedback loop restores cAMP levels.  ALso, transient increase in pPP2A.

Possibly include this in model constraints?

2. low basal ACh condition - try to simulate LTD in TAN specific D2R KO mouse
Very slight boost to cAMP signaling.  Likely not sufficient to eliminante LTD.  Perhaps an even lower basal ACh would work?

B. Robustness sims
1. Model_slow_diffusion
   Theta burst: both block M1 and block MGlu produce drastic reduction in dendritic Pkc and CamKII.  block M1 does not reduce spine head Pkc.  Interesting, the "control" sims have very low 2ag.
   20Hz: block MGlu reduces spine Pkc (but not 2ag) block M1 reduces dend 2ag and Pkc.
   in both cases, gradients of CamKII and 2ag are small (but perhaps greater than before).
      	   10hz   theta
   Ca dend 0.6	  5u
      spine 0.9	  10u

2. Model_m1spine3 (m1 and mGluR both mainly in spine, slow diffusion)
   Theta burst: both block M1 and block MGlu produce drastic reduction in spine Pkc and CamKII.  Block M1 does not reduce spine head Pkc.  Interesting, the "control" sims have very low 2ag.
   20Hz: Both block M1 and block MGlu exhibit reduced 2ag, especially at 2-3 min after induction
   In both cases, calcium gradient is 2:1, despite reduction in dendritic calcium injection!
      	   10hz   theta
   Ca dend 0.6	  5u
      spine 0.9	  10u

Side effect of confining Gq receptors mostly to spine: peak 2ag and Pkc are quite low in dendrite, 2ag is somewhat low in spine.
peak: tbs dend  20hz dend  tbs spine  20hz spine  
Pkc  	 34	6  	   405        85  
2ag  	 48	44	   145	      122

What next?
A) re-run with even smaller dendritic calcium injection
B) re-run with same dendritic injection and fixed buffer
C) re-run everything to see if predictions improve (i.e., new control)


Choose (B) - discovered mistake in calbindin backward rate constant - too fast by e-3 - too low affinity (was 700 uM instead of 700 nM)!
Repeat, also with non-diffusible fixed buffer.  Expect that calcium concentration may be much lower.  Perhaps fixed buffer with Kd of 50 uM may partly replace role of calbindin.  See whether the slightly higher affinity binding of fixed buffer compared to Calbindin will reduce diffusion of calcium into dendrite.
Slightly decrease Dag degradation or 2ag degradation a bit more
2ag: from 0.05 to 0.04 degrad
dagK: from 0.035e-6 to 0.03e-6

-->Model_m1spine4

Depending on results, may need to adjust calcium injection, and then re-run everything.  Re-analyze all (put set of python calls into batch file to process data for SAS and trace figures).  Re-do SAS analysis, predictions. Possibly submit as is and update figures in revisions?

PLAN:
11/21/2017:
1. Update IC file according to above
2. Rerun nostim case for new IC
3. Redo m1spine4 sims with 3x calcium into spine
4. Create and run CaBath stim as well as Uchi sims (0 DHPG only)

SIMS STARTED
11/27/2017
1. Assess nostim case - how are IC?
2. Create new Model files for all sims
3. Create 3 .bat files with ~equal numbers of simulations.  Run on Asia's and Zbyszek's computers.
4. Update calcium for Uchi and Ca bath as needed

>>>>>>>>>>>>Results.
1. calcium too low for Dhpg sims, especially for 100 ms Ca - increase calcium influx. - Triple calcium during 1st 100 ms: from 18 to 54 for spine, from 80 to 240 for dend)
2. bath: almost 1 uM calcium.  Dp34PP1 decreases more than 50%.  Double initial 100 ms of calcium (from 40 to 80), and increase from 7 to 8.0 the next 900 ms to achieve slightly higher calcium.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Results
1. Ca = 0.47 uM briefly for 100ms Ca
      	> 0.4 uM for 2 s for 1s Ca
	1.2 uM peak, > 1 uM from 47 - 50 s
GOOD ENOUGH  BUT, no fixed B in simulation - redo all.  Increase 900 ms of calcium from 3/15 to 4/20.  Increase 2nd sec of calcium from 2.5/12.5 to 3/15.

2. Bath: Ca=900 nM (similar).  PP2Acal increases from ~0 to 200 nM, but PP2ABPR72 is still 900 nM, so activity hasn't increased tremendously.  Try much higher calcium.  Double 1st 100 ms and next 900 ms, and next X sec.

############# Re run bathCa, add in bath Da, DaCa and block OA
	      Re-run Uchi sims, with additional dhpg conc

NEXT:
5:	Da0.1, 0.3, 1, 10 (expect no change), noACh 
5:	block CyA, Pap, Roli, CyA-bathCa, OA-bathCa (possible change in CyA/OA)
10:	(20hz,tbs) X (blockM4, blockPKA2, noDa, noCKp, stdpfino)
8-14:	(20hz,tbs) X (alcCtrl, alcIC, alcNMDA, alcNMDA_Da_IC, alcNMDA_Da?, alcNMDA_IC?, alc_Da_IC?)
6:	(20hz,tbs) X (AChflat, AChnoB, AChnoDip)
5-7 days
multi-spine sims: (20hz,tbs) X (1sp, 2sp_adj, 2sp_sep) - run on Asia's computer at same time?
