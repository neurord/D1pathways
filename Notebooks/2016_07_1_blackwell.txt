&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS:
    1. Validate the nostim and ACh depletion cases. Da durations (Castro) with lower ACh during Da stim
    2. bath and block cases for final tuning
     	use ic start and earlier application for bath cases to save  computational time
    3. Then, repeat 20hz vs theta, create signature
    4. Multi-spine sims - spatial specificity
    5. Other questions:
       a. role of ACh during burst or pause or rebound?
       b. confirm role of CamKII phos Dgl?
       c. Can molecules substitute for others in signature?
    5. parameter robusteness

########## New simulations as of July 1, 2016
USE
a. faster PKA - 5x faster than previous, but still ~2x lower than Jeanette
b. greater Gs hydrolysis (4x faster) PLUS lower affinity of ACh for m4 - these should balance somewhat wrt cAMP
c. double rate of PKA phos of PDE4/10, PP1 dephos of PDE4/10 (to reduce their dephos when PKA and p34DARPPP32 are high) - these should enhance control of cAMP during bath application
d. dendritic injection (instead of fake spines) - this should improve computational efficiency somewhat
e. AC1: help support cAMP basal in response to the greater Gs hydrolysis.
f. pDagL: same Km, but 20% of DagL activity (vs 50% to enhance CamKII effect) - alternative is faster CamKII phos

SIMULATE:
1. Da stim 0.1-10sec using lower rate of ACh (0.3 instead of 0.5), and AKAR
2. Repeat nostim and noACh using faster PDE phos, PP1 dephos

CONSIDER:
1a. double rate of PP2B dephos of p34-DARPP-32 if basal is too high
1b. 5x faster CamKII phos of DagL (going back to higher pDagL activity) if still insufficient 2ag suppression
2. Eliminate ATP.  If no depletion, then either have 1000x lower ATP with 1000x faster kf,
   or incorporate ATP binding into production rate
   i.e., ACGsa->AcGsa+cAMP using VMax, since ATP conc is ~10x greater than Km
   This will eliminate 1 diffusing species of high conc, and 4 reactions
3. New method for compensating for injected molecules (test this with no other changes):
   a. inject Da and Dbuf together as Dabuf to control amount injected
   b. have fast dissociation of Dabuf into Da(internal) and Dbuf (external)
   c. DaOut still reactions with Dbuf, but goes to null (don't track it?)
   d. balanced Da and Dbuf means that basal DaOut doesn't need to be large to avoid baseline shifts
      - lower quantities means lower diffusion
      - eliminate the specification of separate Dbuf and calculation of compensatory amounts
   e. Do the same for GluOut and Gbuf.
4. To speed Da pulses: increase extrusion rate, e.g. 10x; increase injected amount to compensate, e.g. 10x
   test this AFTER testing new method for compensation

&&&&&&& To finish model:
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

Still need to evaluate the following:
1. Chuhma et al., 2014: 10 ms time constant for action of activated G proteins -> may need faster G protein production (and degradation).  Currently G protein production is considerably slower than DaD1RGs binding?
