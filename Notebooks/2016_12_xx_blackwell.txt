&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause - repeat sims without ACh burst 
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

		 6. alcohol effects, parameter robusteness

##############New parameters - Dec 14, 2016
1. Need to reduce ACh during bath, e.g. for 10s, similar to the Dopamine duration sims
2. Reduce Da and Ca peak values - likely smaller effect on Da than on Ca
******StimDend_DaBath, StimDend_CaBath, StimDend_DaCaBath
Ca stim at 21s reduced from 6.9 to 5.0
Da stim reduced from 45 to 40 at 20s, from 6 to 4 at 100 ms and 1s
ACh paused for 10s at 20s
3. Reduce pPP2A by decreasing PKA activity for this molecule - presently kcat=0.06 for PP2a, vs 0.006 for PDE10
   will increase Dp75 and pPP2A, which might actually affect (reduce) Dp34
   Kf=0.0008, kb=0.12, kcat=0.02 - one third activity.  Can't reduce too much, else Da will not cause Dp75 decrease

>>>>>>Results, basal
cAMP:60, PKAc: 5.7, , pPDE10: 14.1 - no change
Gs part - no change: GsaGTP: 1 AC5Gsa=3.7 GiaGTP: 102 AC5Gia: 595  AC5GsaGiaATP 228      AC5GsaGia: 3     AC5GsaATP  30
pPP2A: 27 MUCH LOWER - this is excellent

Bath:	  Da   	  Ca      DaCa
cAMP	  >15uM	  100n	  >6uM
Dp34 	  4.4u	  300n	  slow decrement
Dp75		  6.9u

cAMP still a bit high.  Da basal=11.5 - perhaps lowering this a bit would help.
cAMP with Da is huge but quite transient - due to reduction in Gi for 10s - don't lower ACh as much.

########### New parametes - Dec 16, 2016
Note that ACh has been 70 nM basal with new version, but cannot reduce since cAMP too high
Reduce ACh only by 50% for 10s during Da bath, and more prolonged (20s)
Make DaD1R=0 (instead of 3) to reduce basal cAMP (and D32p34PP1) without blunting peak
Dp34 still decreasing with DaCa - PKA not strong enough to overcome Pp2B.  More prolonged ACh reduction may help this.  Also, eliminate PP2Acal activity against Dp34.

>>>>>>>>RESULTS
nostim: Da=10 (good) cAMP=61 (no better) PKAc=5.9 (no better) pPP2A=36 (no better)
Gs part - no change: GsaGTP: 1 AC5Gsa=3.7 GiaGTP: 102 AC5Gia: 595  AC5GsaGiaATP 228      AC5GsaGia: 3     AC5GsaATP  30

	   basal      Da   	  Ca	   DaCa	    CyA 	OA
cAMP	   60	      1856	  113n	   1411	    NA		NA
Dp34 	   886n	      4.0u	  	   2.1u	    1.4u	1.5u	
Dp75	   10.5u      9.3u	  6.9u	   6.1u	    10.9u	3.6u
D32p75PKAc  25n	      175n	  42n	   107n	    39		114

--------->reducing ACh to 0.15 was good - peak cAMP=2 uM, but need to prolong the reduction, e.g. 100s?
Now there is insufficient pPP2A to reduce Dp75 with Da alone - would this be fixed by more prolonged cAMP?
DaCa case still does not increase Dp34 - is Pp2B too strong?  Would more prolonged cAMP counteract Pp2B?
Why is Da stil on 200s long, but Ca stim is 200s long?
In fact, there is sharp dip in cAMP when ACh is restored, and then a drop in cAMP when Da stops.  the latter corresponds to decrease in Dp34.
Would this also fix the Dp75 part?  Possibly need to restore part of the PKA phos of PP2A -
Dp75 inhibition of PKAc limits the Dp34 increase with OA block
2. Consider partial restoring of PKA phos of PP2A, e.g. kcat=0.03e-3, kf,kb=.00125,0.185

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Results of theta and 20hz
Glu transients are very long - >5 sec - speed the pumping/extrusion?
######Fa. double the dissociation of Glu from Gbuf (from 10 to 20 - same as DaDbuf)
######Fb. increase extrusion rate - from 0.6 to 1.2 (and kb from .03 to .06), which may halve the peak value - from 4u to 2u
ACh transients exceed 1 uM - what should they be?  Unclear.  Reduce injection anyway because cAMP is too low.
######ACh stim change from rate=8.0 to rate =4.0
Neither of these will affect steady state.
Note that PP2A dephos of D32p34PP1 is lower than of D32p34 - could increase these a bit to lower basal D32p34, then would emphasize effect of OA block, e.g. 10% increase? 
---->Re-run theta and 20hz after seeing results of Bath and Uchi, possibly with slightly higher Pp2A dephos rates for D32p34PP1

>>>>>>>>Gq pathways:
no MGlu produces large decrease in Gq, but only small change in Ip3 and 2ag
no ACh (constant ACh) produces a smaller change in Gq - blunts the early peak, but not later part of the peak, but produces a larger reduction in Ip3 and 2ag.  Both show reduction in PlcCaGq, no ACh has smaller Pip2 bound form.  Gq bound Plc (~10nM) is still quite small compared to the Ca alone form (~160 nM peaks), so may not  contribute much, especially in spine with higher Ca conc.
Briefer Glu may reveal larger effect of blocking ACh modulation on Gq.
--------> Consider lower Plc affinity for  calcium to enhance Gq role (and lower 2ag basal) - depends on Uchi sims

###############
1. FIX BATH STIM - no need to re-run other cases - prolong Da stim and ACh decrease extra 100s
2. double again rate of CyA block of PP2B - re-run just this case
3. Eliminate PP2Acal dephosphorylates D32p34.  With bath calcium, D32p34 dephos is stronger than without - may contribute to the DaCa reduction. Would have minimal effect on steady state. Hopefully will have minimal effect on Ca alone, since very little D32p34 in this condition.
Shouldn't have effect on block either - since only 1 of these molecules ever observed.

4.Run Uchi sims
a. Depth 2D is now 0.6, was 0.4, diameter is now 0.9, was 1.0
volume now: 0.6*0.9, =0.54; volume prior: 0.4*1.0 = 0.444
For Uchi sims, adjust depth2D to equate volume.  Make depth2D=0.45
b. Once depth2D is adjusted, can use same stimulation quantities - just create new Model files
   depth2d=0.45
   latest rxn file, but with dhpg uncommented
c. edit stim files to:
   x1. add in ACh
   x2. change start time to 20s
   x3. change sa2 to dend:submembrane
   x4. change dhpg to glu
   5. May need to change Glu inject if it doesn't stay constant.  Possibly inject GluGbuf instead of Glu

>>>>>>>Results of new Bath and Uchi sims - 12-20-16
Better cAMP signal - exceeds 1 uM for ~100s
D32p34 is no better - Da+Ca still does not exceed basal.  Replacement of ACh does lower D32p34 and cAMP - prolong this effect, but wouldn't fix problem.
D32p75: definitely better.  Decreases to 8.8u with Da alone
-------> Restore some of PKA phos of PP2A activity.  this will increase the D32p75 dip with Da, and possibly further reduce pp2a activity against Dp34, and possibly reduce PKA activity against D32 via competition.  Reduce D32p75 may also provide more PKA for Dp34.

UCHI:
Glu is too high!  39 instead of 25, 7.9 instead of 5, 1.8 instead of 1.0 -> suggests that depth2D is too small?
WORSE: GqaGTP has no effect on Ip3 or 2ag -  possibly because Ca is saturating Plc?  Larger depth2D/volume would lower ca conc - may make Gq more important.
Spine head conc = 1.5u vs 1u for dend (1s), and 4 uM vs 3.5u (5s) - too high for DSI protocol - lower spine calcium inject
-------->depth2D=0.6 will lower dend calcium, make PLC more dependent on Gq
		     lower spine calcium inject, make PLC more dependent on Gq, OR
		     lower Plc affinity for calcium? - make PLC more dependent on Gq, lower basal Ip3 and 2ag
Dag certainly depends on Dhpg conc in the spine - why no effect on 2ag?  2ag conc = 10% of Dag conc
Dhpg effect on overall Dag is low, since dhpg doesn't produce Gq in the dendrite
     Also, the Dag with lowest amount of dhpg (1 uM) saturates the CaDgl - again eliminating a difference in 2ag due to dhpg.  Strangely, the 2ag doesn't increase with dag.  

BLock: OA increases Dp34 ~50%
       CyA block also increases Dp34 ~50%
  -----> These are much better than previous values.  OA binding is still faster than CyA binding, which corresponds to the faster Dp34 increase with OA. Will leave speed as is for now.

No ACh case: transient increase in cAMP to 1.6u, then decreases to 200 nM.  No too bad.

#########New params - re-run no stim case
1. ACh lowered to 0.15 for 200s - to help Bath DaCa case
2. PKA phos against PP2A: 0.00125, 0.185, 0.03 - to help Bath DaCa case
3. Increase PP2A activity 10% to lower basal Dp34 (and increase effect of OA block)
4. Depth2D=0.6 for Uchi - will lower Glu /dhpg conc to proper amount
5. Glu inject to dend:submembrane instead of spine, since dhpg is bath applied
6. Lower PLC affinity for Calcium by 20%: 2500 nM for Plc + Ca, 500 nM for PlcGq + Ca

>>>>>>>>>>>Bath:
Basal: D32p34=735 - great
Dp75 decreases to 8.1u with Da - better, but
Dp34 only increases to 1.1u with Da+Ca - better, but still not good enough

-->Solution: decrease calcium injection 20% for less Pp2B activation

>>>>>>>>Uchi:
Glu is much better: 1.3 uM, 30 uM - still 20-30% too high - reduce 20%
Basal Dag=302-311, 2ag=60-80, IP3=200-300 - much lower 2ag basal
100ms calcium: still no effect of Glu!
3. Dgl decreases to 300 briefly during calcium - still room for further decrease
2. Dag slightly increases with Glu, even though GqaGTP increases greatly
1. PlcCaGq increases the tiniest amount - only 4 molecules!
PlcCa increases a bit during calcium, but quite low
Spine: GqaGTP increases to 600 nM - sufficient
       PlcGq increases from 0 to 50nm (but only 2 molecules!)
       PlcCaGqPip2 increases from 0 to 1 molecule!
       Dag increases in spine head from ~80 to 600nM - but still a small fraction of total because not seen when averaged over dendrite
       Dgl decreases to 0, suggesting it  could be limiting with higher DAG
----> increase Plc (triple) and Dgl (double)  in spine - consistent with mGluR and Gq increase in spine

############## Additional new parameters to achieve lower cAMP basal:
decrease ACh basal - inject 0.2 vs 0.3 (all stim files), and decrease Gs production - kcat from 0.25 to 0.15 (Rxn)
increase Plc (triple) and Dgl (double) in spine (IC file)
decrease calcium injection 20% for less Pp2B activation in Ca bath stim
>>>>>>>Results Basal:
>>>>>> ACh=48, cAMP=46, Dp34: 549: PERFECT, pPP2A: 36, Dp75:10.5
Gs part - lower: GsaGTP: 0.6 AC5Gsa=3.2 GiaGTP: 70 AC5Gia: 596  AC5GsaGiaATP 139      AC5GsaGia: 2     AC5GsaATP  24

SIMULATE ALL EXPERIMENTS

------->A) Research effects of alcohol.
	   investigate something about plasticity and alcohol
	B) What stimulation protocol would optimize LTP?
	   According to Reynolds - burst of Da needs to be AFTER ACh burst, e.g. by 0.6 sec.  Adjust theta stim file to achieve this.
&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

For publication, do we simulate a D2R model?  Or alcohol effects?
