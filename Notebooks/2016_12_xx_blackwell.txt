&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause - repeat sims without ACh burst 
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

		 6. alcohol effects, parameter robusteness

##############New parameters - Dec 14, 2016
1. Need to reduce ACh during bath, e.g. for 10s, similar to the Dopamine duration sims
2. Reduce Da and Ca peak values - likely smaller effect on Da than on Ca
******StimDend_DaBath, StimDend_CaBath, StimDend_DaCaBath
Ca stim at 21s reduced from 6.9 to 5.0
Da stim reduced from 45 to 40 at 20s, from 6 to 4 at 100 ms and 1s
ACh paused for 10s at 20s
3. Reduce pPP2A by decreasing PKA activity for this molecule - presently kcat=0.06 for PP2a, vs 0.006 for PDE10
   will increase Dp75 and pPP2A, which might actually affect (reduce) Dp34
   Kf=0.0008, kb=0.12, kcat=0.02 - one third activity.  Can't reduce too much, else Da will not cause Dp75 decrease

>>>>>>Results, basal
cAMP:60, PKAc: 5.7, , pPDE10: 14.1 - no change
Gs part - no change: GsaGTP: 1 AC5Gsa=3.7 GiaGTP: 102 AC5Gia: 595  AC5GsaGiaATP 228      AC5GsaGia: 3     AC5GsaATP  30
pPP2A: 27 MUCH LOWER - this is excellent

Bath:	  Da   	  Ca      DaCa
cAMP	  >15uM	  100n	  >6uM
Dp34 	  4.4u	  300n	  slow decrement
Dp75		  6.9u

cAMP still a bit high.  Da basal=11.5 - perhaps lowering this a bit would help.
cAMP with Da is huge but quite transient - due to reduction in Gi for 10s - don't lower ACh as much.

########### New parametes - Dec 16, 2016\
Note that ACh has been 70 nM basal with new version, but cannot reduce since cAMP too high
Reduce ACh only by 50% for 10s during Da bath, and more prolonged (20s)
Make DaD1R=0 (instead of 3) to reduce basal cAMP (and D32p34PP1) without blunting peak
Dp34 still decreasing with DaCa - PKA not strong enough to overcome Pp2B.  More prolonged ACh reduction may help this.  Also, eliminate PP2Acal activity against Dp34.

>>>>>>>>RESULTS

--------->reducing ACh to 0.15 was good - peak cAMP=2 uM, but need to prolong the reduction, e.g. 100s?
Now there is insufficient pPP2A to reduce Dp75 with Da alone - would this be fixed by more prolonged cAMP?
DaCa case still does not increase Dp34 - is Pp2B too strong?  Would more prolonged cAMP counteract Pp2B?
Why is Da stil on 200s long, but Ca stim is 200s long?
In fact, there is sharp dip in cAMP when ACh is restored, and then a drop in cAMP when Da stops.  the latter corresponds to decrease in Dp34.
Would this also fix the Dp75 part?  Possibly need to restore part of the PKA phos of PP2A -
Dp75 inhibition of PKAc limits the Dp34 increase with OA block
2. Consider partial restoring of PKA phos of PP2A, e.g. kcat=0.03e-3, kf,kb=.00125,0.185

###############
1. FIX BATH STIM - no need to re-run other cases - prolong Da stim and ACh decrease extra 100s
2. double again rate of CyA block of PP2B - re-run just this case

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Results of theta and 20hz
Glu transients are very long - >5 sec - speed the pumping/extrusion?
######Fa. double the dissociation of Glu from Gbuf (from 10 to 20 - same as DaDbuf)
######Fb. increase extrusion rate - from 0.6 to 1.2 (and kb from .03 to .06), which may halve the peak value - from 4u to 2u
ACh transients exceed 1 uM - what should they be?  Unclear.  Reduce injection anyway because cAMP is too low.
######From rate=8.0 to rate =4.0
Neither of these will affect steady state

Run Uchi sims
1. Depth 2D is now 0.6, was 0.4, diameter is now 0.9, was 1.0
volume now: 0.6*0.9, =0.54; volume prior: 0.4*1.0 = 0.444
For Uchi sims, adjust depth2D to equate volume.  Make depth2D=0.45
2. Once depth2D is adjusted, can use same stimulation quantities - just create new Model files
   depth2d=0.45
   latest rxn file, but with dhpg uncommented
3. edit stim files to:
   x1. add in ACh
   x2. change start time to 20s
   x3. change sa2 to dend:submembrane
   x4. change dhpg to glu
   5. May need to change Glu inject if it doesn't stay constant.  Possibly inject GluGbuf instead of Glu 

Once basal is good, consider tuning phosphatase activity against D32p34, and the Gq pathways.  Is it necessary to have small mGluR in the dendrites?

------->A) Research effects of alcohol.
	   investigate something about plasticity and alcohol
	B) What stimulation protocol would optimize LTP?
	   According to Reynolds - burst of Da needs to be AFTER ACh burst, e.g. by 0.6 sec.  Adjust theta stim file to achieve this.
>>>Added in DaDelay case

&&&&&& To finish model (may help with degradation of Gi during ACh pauses):
   Note that PKA phos of RGS will not help theta since PKA is same for theta and 20 Hz
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps - not too fast to avoid decreasing other Dp34 basal)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

For publication, do we simulate a D2R model?  Or alcohol effects?
