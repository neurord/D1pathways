Analysis steps
1. Use sig.py to calculate "molecule sum" traces, e.g., sum all PKAc bound molecules to create PKA trace.
   Can use wildcards in specifying filename of h5 files to generate these *plas.txt files for numerous cases at a time
   Output is one column per trial per region and a column for the mean (and stdev) over trials
   Regions are currently specified in the code itself (and not as input argument).
   
2. Use sig2_60s.py to extract time samples for use in discriminant analysis.  I.e., extract the mean over X sec at baseline, Y and Z time points for a set of molecules.  The set of molecules is specified as the name of the molecule sum traces output by sig.py.  X is the window over which the average is calculated - can specify more than one value.  Y and Z are center time points of the average - can specify multiple time points.  A single output file is created, with one line per simulation.  Extracted values are for both the spine and the dendrite.

3. Discriminant analysis in Sas used the set of simulations whose experimental outcomes are known. On cross-validation it was able to get all but 20Hz - block mGluR correct.  Then used same discriminant vectors to classify/predict the simulations (LTP, LTD or No Change) for which experimental outcomes not known.  Applied this also to the alcohol withdrawn case.
   the time samples with 60s window for average worked best, measured at 60s after stimulation start.
   The regions that worked best were spine for PKC, dendrite for 2ag and Epac.  I used PKA phosphorylated proteins in the spine and pCamKII in the dendrite.

4. To generate molecule signature traces for figures, I was guided by discriminant analysis - thus Epac1+pCamKII-2AG in the dendrite, and PKA phos +PKC in the spine.

5. sig.py can now calculate a distance dependent average of the dendrite (make spatialaverage=1 in the code).  This is useful for creating image plots of dendritic spatial specificity for the long dendrite / multi-spine case.

6. Performed additional robustness simulations, with
a. different diffusion constants and degradation rates of 2ag
b. higher and lower (AC, PDE) concentrations
c. lower dopamine during stimulation
d. slower CamKII diffusion

Analysis of robustness simulations:

********************** Mistake discovered in reaction files: activity of AC1GsaGTP bound CamCa4 is 1000x lower than it should be!  I.e.  AC1GsaGTPCamCa4 (+ ATP)  â‡ŒAC1GsaGTPCamATP is 1000x lower forward rate.

Need to re-run a few simulations and assess whether change is significant.  If so, re-run all simulations (first  check robustness to see if better parameters are evident)
