Signatures
1. Aphos vs AphosNoPP differ in that the former includes Dp34 bound to PP2BCamCa4 and PP2BCamCa2
PKAcplas includes: PKAcDaD1RGs PKAcPDE10 PKAcPDE10cAMP PKAcPDE4 PKAcPDE4cAMP PKAcPP2AB56d D32PKAc
Aphos includes: pDaD1RGs pGsD1R pPDE10 pPDE10cAMP pPDE4 pPDE4cAMP pPP2A D32p34 D32p34PP1 D32p34PP1PP2BCamCa4 D32p34PP1PP2BCamCa2C
AphosNoPP includes: pDaD1RGs pGsD1R pPDE10 pPDE10cAMP pPDE4 pPDE4cAMP pPP2A D32p34 D32p34PP1
2. CKpCam and CKpDlg differ in that the latter includes pDgl, pCaDgl - i.e., additional targets
Using CKpCam signature means including all non-phosphatase bound forms of active & phosphorylated CamKII, i.e.:
CKpCam includes: CKpCamCa4 CKp Dgl_CKp Dgl_CKpCamCa4 CaDgl_CKpCamCa4

sig_60s.py processes the output text files of sig.py in order to extract "features", e.g. mean value at various time points
the second number indicate whether a 30s or 60 s window for average
the 1st number (or two), e.g. 60, 90 or 60and120, indicates the time point for the average
All these files, as of Aug 10, use AphosNoPP and CKpCam as the PKA and CKp measures

Evaluation of signatures:
1. read above files into SAS.  Create "outcomes" file - which indicates whether the protocol produced LTP, LTD, No Change, or Unknown
2. Use known results protocols in discriminant analysis - which time points give best results on cross -validation
3. Evaluate unknown outcomes to generate predictions

Still need to edit sig2_60s.py to create appropriate file format for multi-spine simulations - DONE, but need to verify debugged by comparing output values with input values
Need to run sig.py on the multi-spine sims to generate signature files - DONE

Above measures do not use thresholds, either amplitude or duration thresholds.  The discrim will select weight for combining different features, but this is linear.  Unknown how to determine optimal threshold to enhance discrimination (or whether it would improve things).

param variations-evaluate Epac1cAMP CKpCamCa4 D32p34PP1 2ag PkcCaDag
1. CKp diffusion - same 
2. Da80 - lower D32p34PP1, but similar relationshp between 20hz and theta
3. m1spine: 20hz block m1 didn't run - simulate over weekend
   block Mglu severly reduces Pkc in spine for theta, block M1 severly reduces Pkc in dendrite for theta.
   block m1 severly reduces pkc in spine for 20hz - but this probably doesn't matter since Pkc not needed for 20hz ltd.
   block m1 likely reduces 2ag in dendrite and spine, since it does for theta.
   prediction: block m1 and block Mglu will disrupt theta LTP due to Pkc in spine and dendrite
   	       block m1 will likely disrupt 20hz LTD due to 2ag.  block mglu produces only small reduction of 2ag in dendrite.
	       Need to see how discriminant analysis works.

When creating files for discrim - can process the 40-50 s baseline files separately from 10-20s, and then concatenate them.
