########### New pDaD1RGs pathways
	    PKA phos rates:  kf = 0.008e-03, kb=0.8e-03, kcat=0.2e-03 (10x higher)
	    pDaD1RGs <-> Da + pD1RGs, NEW Rxn - Kd=1 uM: kf=0.1, kb=0.1e-3 (with Da=10 nM, kb=1e-3, with Da=1000, Da=0.1)
	    pD1RGs -> GsD1R, NEW Rxn - Kf=0.02e-03
	    	   (10x faster than prior rxn with Da bound, 20x faster than kb with 10 nM Da. 5x slower than kb with 1000 nM Da)
	    pDaD1RGs -> Da+D1R+Gsabg, kf=0.0002e-03 (10x slower than previous)
	    Glu diffusion lowered from from 2 to 1
	    Glu stimulation reduced by 4x, from 4.5 to 1.125
Test new D1R phos with (1) Da bath, (2) nostim, (3) theta
Test new Glu with (1) theta vs m1 block - ensure low Gq dend


     	 pDaD1RGs pGsD1R     cAMP     GluSp 	GluDend
DaB 5/1	    250nM    x 	     37 uM    N/A	N/A
theta 5/1   15 nM    x 	     0.7 uM   7 uM	0.8 uM
Da Bath	    370	     40nM    5uM			Great!  though quite transient. Perhaps reduce PDE2?
no Stim	    0	     0	     50n
Theta	    20 nM    40	     0.5 uM   2.2u	0.2 uM  Better, though most of effect due to lower Glu overall

Slightly lower GqaGTP with the lower Glu Spine
blockM1 has same GqaGTP through DAG as no block - still too much Glu mediated GqaGTP?  Yes and No:
NO, still too much ACh bound to m1RGq!  Telenzm1RGq=200, telenzm1R = 1, free m1R=8, m1RGq=200, free telenz=1, AChm1RGq=16
YES, GluMGluRGq was 50 (diff=2), and now is 25

A. Repeat same set of sims with lower PDE2 - back to original values?  OR, slower D1R inactivation?
   Slow down D1R inact - happending within 60s - halve reactions PKAc phos DaD1RGs
B. Lower Glu diffusion still more to enhance spine to dend ratio, e.g. 0.1
C. inject more telenz, e.g. 2x or 2.5x - check on m4 block! FINE.

Earlier evaluation of having implicit ATP gave different results - possibly due to tolerance problem.  Repeat this assessment.
