&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

NEXT STEPS:
     1. Fix/verify dendritic injection - using bath and bathDend (Wed)
     Thurs or Fri:
     2. Repeat fastPKA simulation, then evaluate the fast PKA and decide whether (how) to keep (or not)
     3. Fix non-ACh basal cAMP value (vs nostim): STEP 1 = GsaGTPase = 0.5e-3.
     	a. add in Ca inhib of AC5? - NO, this will be too low at basal Ca
	b. enhance GsaGTP degradation rate?  Decrease Gsabg quantity?  Enhance PKA phos of PDE4/10? or PDE quantity?  A little of each?
	GsaGTPase = 0.125e-3, vs 1.0e-3 for Gi and Gq
	Gsabg=1840nM / 1945 pSD vs Gi=1760nM / 1700pSD vs Gq=2000nM / 1000pSD.  Is Gs less abundant than Gi?
	c. run several nostim cases, use end of sim for IC for all but block cases, and use new IC values for block cases
   Start June 5-10:
     4. Once ACh block is reasonable, test Da timing with lower ACh
     5. Once Da bath looks good, add in AC1 and evaluate bath and block cases
     	use ic start and earlier application for bath cases
     6. Then, do 20hz vs theta
     
########## Testing out new features of neurord using NeuroRD-3.1.1
A. Evaluate injection directly into dendrite
   1. Repeat bath simulations using -Dneurord.trials=3 (Da, Ca, DaCa, OA, CyA)
      Discovered that ACh was injected into spine for block trials - fix and repeat these
   2. Eliminate FAKE spines and stimulate directly into dendrite - 3 trials (Da, Ca, DaCa, OA, CyA)

>>>>>>>> Fake spines are acting differently than submembrane injection.  Injection is higher for submembrane injection.  Is this caused by treating the inject rate spec differently?  I.e., fake spine rate is distributed over spines (divided by number of spines).  Perhaps submembrane inject provides same amount to each spine?
>>>>>>>> How is ACH value?
	 overall: ~80 nM - good; spine:
>>>>>>>Multiple trials of CyA?
	Reveals large variation.  
B. Begin test of restart facility
   1. Run no-stim simulation for steady state
   2. repeat 20Hz and Theta sims 2 more times using --ic nostim.h5 and --ic-time -1

C.########## What happens if decrease ACh alone??
Model_SPNspineCaMKII_DagL_AChm4R-noACh.xml - this eliminates the basal ACh stim.
>>>>>>>cAMP increases to 4 uM, Dp34PP1 exceeds 4 uM.
Compare to nostim (which keeps basal cAMP): basal cAMP closer to 10, because ACh is way too high (~500)
	Large ACh due to dendritic stim (no fake spines)
NONETHELESS, basal Gs is too strong, since removing Gi produces very strong cAMP response
This reveals that (1) can increase basal cAMP and Dp34PP1 by reducing Gi
     	     (2) need to decrease Gs, and/or increase PDE4/10 so that ACh block has smaller effect on cAMP

D. ########## Should PKA activation be faster still?  Might need to compensate some reactions (NO!):
   a. dephos of DaD1RGS - currently 1st order - easy to speed up, but also could use phosphatase
   b. dephos of PDEs - currently 1st order - easy to speed up, but also could use phosphatase
   c. DARPP: currently value is a bit low, so doubling PKA would not need to be compensated completely.  PP2B dephos kcat is currently 0.5.  Measured value: King, Hemmings: Vmax =0.2-1/sec.  So, could speed this up.
   d. AKAR3
Note that increased activation rate of PKA will mostly not affect the basal, steady state level.  It  could have small effect if PKAc dissociated more often from PKAr at basal level.  But if no change in basal, then no need to compensate the dephos rates, EXCEPT the AKAR3 since it is too high.
-------> repeat the nostim case with 5x rate of PKA activation (Jeanette uses 20x the current rate!)
>>>>>>>> PKAfast (nostim - high basal ACh) has much better basal D32p34PP1.  Thus, once ACh and basal Gs is sorted, this is good method for increasing D32p34PP1 basal value while keeping low cAMP and  PKAc.  However, should not increase still further.

E. New parameters (once dend injection is sorted)
   1. Add AC1 - 10% of AC5 values
   2. reduce PKA phos of DaD1R and PDE4/10?  Perhaps not needed as strong given the strong ACh->Gi?
   3. Consider lower ACh level for the Da stim sims
   4. Keep faster PKA depending on results

&&&&&&& To finish model:
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
   small amount of AC1 to allow Theta to have higher cAMP and PKA??
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

Still need to evaluate the following:
1. Chuhma et al., 2014: 10 ms time constant for action of activated G proteins -> may need faster G protein production (and degradation).  Currently G protein production is considerably slower than DaD1RGs binding?
